## Academic Sources

### Primary Source
- **Authors**: Dr. John Grinder (co-creator of NLP)
- **Year**: Late 1970s/Early 1980s (specific publication date not definitively established)
- **Title**: Circle of Excellence (developed as part of NLP core techniques)
- **Context**: Evolved from spatial anchoring concepts in NLP
- **URL**: https://nlppod.com/circle-of-excellence/
- **Key Findings**: Combines spatial anchoring (physical location as trigger) with resource stacking (multiple positive states layered together). Creates powerful compound state that can be accessed by stepping into imagined or physical circle. Particularly effective for pre-performance preparation.
- **Effect Size**: No formal meta-analysis available; effectiveness documented through practitioner case studies and NLP training outcomes

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From NLP Training Organizations:**
1. Circle should be imagined as vividly as possible (color, size, texture, energy)
2. Only add genuinely resourceful states - authenticity is critical
3. States should be fully associated (experienced from inside, not observed)
4. Each resource should reach peak intensity before stacking the next
5. The circle becomes a portable anchor - can be imagined anywhere
6. Most effective when practiced repeatedly before high-stakes situations

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Circle Creation (2-3 minutes)**
1. Ask client to imagine a circle on the floor in front of them
2. "What color is your circle? What size? Does it have texture? Does it glow or have energy?"
3. Make the circle as vivid and appealing as possible
4. Client should feel naturally drawn to step into it

**Phase 2: First Resource Identification (1-2 minutes)**
1. "What resourceful emotional state do you need for [upcoming challenge]?"
2. Common responses: confidence, focus, determination, calm, creativity, courage
3. "Think of a specific time when you felt [chosen state] powerfully"
4. Guide to specific memory with sensory details

**Phase 3: Resource Access and Association (2-3 minutes)**
1. Have client fully re-experience the resourceful memory
2. "Step into that memory now, seeing through your own eyes"
3. "What are you seeing? What sounds do you hear? What physical sensations?"
4. Watch for physiological shifts indicating state access
5. Allow state to build to peak intensity

**Phase 4: Stepping Into Circle (30 seconds)**
1. "When that feeling reaches its peak, step into your circle"
2. Physical step forward (or imagined if doing visualization only)
3. "Feel how that resource fills your entire circle"
4. Anchor the state to the spatial location

**Phase 5: Resource Stacking (Repeat Steps 2-4, 3-5 times)**
1. Step out of circle, break state
2. "What other resource would make this even more powerful?"
3. Access second resourceful memory
4. At peak intensity, step into circle again
5. "Notice how these states combine and amplify"
6. Repeat with additional resources (typically 3-5 total)

**Phase 6: Testing and Integration (2 minutes)**
1. Step out of circle completely
2. Break state (neutral topic, shake it off)
3. "Now step back into your circle and notice what happens"
4. All stacked resources should flood back simultaneously
5. If weak, reinforce by re-accessing and re-stacking

**Phase 7: Future Pacing (2-3 minutes)**
1. "Imagine the upcoming situation where you need these resources"
2. "See yourself stepping into your circle just before that moment"
3. "Notice how you perform with all these resources available"
4. Mental rehearsal of success within the circle
5. "You can take this circle with you anywhere - imagine it anytime, anywhere"

### Contraindications
- **Dissociative Disorders**: May be problematic for individuals with dissociative conditions who struggle with grounding
- **Severe Trauma**: Should not be used to process traumatic memories without trained therapeutic supervision
- **Psychosis**: Avoid during active psychotic episodes where distinguishing imagination from reality is impaired
- **Physical Balance Issues**: If doing physical stepping, ensure client has adequate balance and mobility
- **Skepticism/Resistance**: Technique requires imaginative engagement; highly skeptical clients may benefit from cognitive-behavioral approaches instead

### Cautions
- Not a replacement for exposure therapy or trauma treatment
- Requires genuine resourceful memories - cannot fabricate states
- May be less effective for clients who struggle with visualization
- Physical space needed if doing actual stepping (can be adapted to pure visualization)
- Best for performance enhancement, not clinical treatment of mental health conditions

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt (Opening)
"I'd like you to imagine a circle on the floor in front of you. This is your Circle of Excellence, a special space where you'll gather all the resources you need for outstanding performance. What color is your circle? Good. And as you look at it, does it have a glow, an energy, a sense of possibility? Perfect. Now, think of a time when you felt absolutely confident..."

### Example Script Excerpt (Resource Stacking)
"And when that feeling of confidence reaches its absolute peak, step into your circle now. Feel how that confidence fills every part of the circle. Excellent. Now step back out. What's another resource that would be valuable? Focus? Perfect. Remember a time when you were completely focused, in the zone, nothing could distract you..."

### Specific Language Patterns

**Circle Visualization Patterns:**
- "Imagine a circle on the floor in front of you..."
- "What color is your circle? What size? Does it glow?"
- "Make it as appealing and powerful as you want it to be..."

**Resource Access Patterns:**
- "What resourceful state belongs in this circle?"
- "Remember a specific time when you felt [state] powerfully..."
- "Step into that memory, seeing through your own eyes..."

**Stacking Patterns:**
- "When that feeling reaches its peak, step into your circle NOW"
- "Notice how that resource fills your entire circle..."
- "What other resource would make this even more powerful?"

**Testing Patterns:**
- "Step out completely, shake it off... now step back in and notice what happens"
- "All those resources flood back immediately, don't they?"

**Future Pacing Patterns:**
- "Imagine the situation where you need these resources..."
- "See yourself stepping into your circle just before..."
- "You can take this circle with you anywhere in your imagination"

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You CAN STEP INTO your circle and FEEL CONFIDENT now"
- **Presuppositions**: "When you step into your circle..." (presupposes they will)
- **Spatial Anchoring**: Using physical/imagined location as hypnotic anchor
- **Stacked Suggestions**: Multiple positive states suggested sequentially, building upon each other
- **Utilization**: Uses client's own memories and resources (Ericksonian principle)

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Confident, encouraging, energizing - building anticipation for the resource experience
- **Pacing**: Moderate pace, slowing down during peak state moments, energizing during stacking
- **Emphasis**: Emphasize action words ("STEP INTO," "FEEL," "NOTICE") and peak state descriptors
- **Duration**:
  - Initial installation: 12-15 minutes (with 3-5 resources)
  - Quick activation: 1-2 minutes (once established)
  - Reinforcement practice: 5-7 minutes
- **Volume**: Moderate to slightly elevated - conveys enthusiasm and possibility
- **Pauses**: Strategic pauses to allow sensory imagination and state building

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Pre-performance state preparation, confidence building, accessing peak performance states on demand
- **Target Audience**:
  - Athletes preparing for competition
  - Business professionals before presentations or negotiations
  - Entrepreneurs before pitches or high-stakes meetings
  - Performers before going on stage
  - Anyone facing anxiety-provoking situations
  - Sales professionals before important calls
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Pre-competition ritual for athletes
  - Green room visualization before keynote speaking
  - Car park visualization before sales meeting
  - Morning routine to start day in resourceful state
  - Before difficult conversations requiring confidence and calm
  - Job interviews, auditions, performances
  - Transitioning from one role to another (e.g., work to parenting)

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Emerging to Moderate
- **Rationale**: Circle of Excellence combines several evidence-supported elements: spatial anchoring (location-based memory retrieval is well-documented in cognitive psychology), mental rehearsal (strong sports psychology evidence), and classical conditioning principles. However, as an integrated NLP technique, it lacks rigorous controlled trials. Evidence is primarily from:
  1. Practitioner reports and case studies in coaching contexts
  2. Integration into sports psychology protocols
  3. Underlying mechanisms (mental imagery, state management) have independent research support
  4. Widespread adoption in peak performance coaching suggests practical utility

  The technique's effectiveness likely depends heavily on individual differences in visualization ability and hypnotic suggestibility. Best viewed as a practical performance tool rather than empirically validated clinical intervention.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Context
- Developed by John Grinder as extension of NLP anchoring concepts
- Combines spatial anchoring with resource stacking
- One of the first techniques taught in NLP Practitioner training
- Popularized in sports performance and executive coaching contexts

### Variations
**Physical vs. Imaginal:**
- Original version uses physical circle and actual stepping
- Purely imaginal version can be done seated with visualization only
- Hybrid: imagine stepping into circle while seated

**Resource Types:**
- Emotional resources (confidence, calm, determination)
- Cognitive resources (focus, clarity, strategic thinking)
- Physiological resources (energy, relaxation, alertness)
- Social resources (charisma, empathy, authority)

**Circle Characteristics:**
- Size can vary (small personal space to large encompassing area)
- Some practitioners add sensory details (warmth, light, sound)
- Can be portable (imagined anywhere) or location-specific

### Comparison to Other Techniques
- **Standard Anchoring**: Circle of Excellence is spatial anchoring with stacking
- **Safe Place Visualization**: Similar but Circle emphasizes performance, Safe Place emphasizes safety/calm
- **Mental Rehearsal**: Circle includes rehearsal in final future-pacing step
- **Confidence Building**: More structured and multi-dimensional than simple confidence visualization

### Integration with Other Modalities
- Often combined with pre-performance routines in sports psychology
- Can be integrated into hypnotic induction for performance hypnosis
- Works well with goal visualization and implementation intentions
- Complements physical warm-up routines for athletes

### Effectiveness Factors
**Enhances Effectiveness:**
- Strong visualization ability
- Genuine resourceful memories to draw from
- Repeated practice before actual performance situations
- Belief in the technique (expectancy effects)
- Vivid sensory imagination

**Reduces Effectiveness:**
- Skepticism or resistance
- Poor visualization skills
- Trying to fabricate states rather than recall authentic experiences
- Insufficient practice/rehearsal
- Using in crisis without prior installation

### Practical Coaching Tips
- Have clients create their circle first session, reinforce in subsequent sessions
- Encourage daily practice (2 minutes) to strengthen the anchor
- Can stack different resources for different contexts (presentation circle vs. athletic competition circle)
- Photograph or draw the circle to enhance visual recall
- Add personal symbols or meaningful objects to circle in imagination
