# Five-Phase Energizing Script Architecture

**Canonical reference for Myndset's energizing script structure.**
This is the single source of truth for the 5-phase model used across script generators, prompts, and QA checklists.

---

## Overview

Every energizing script follows a proven 5-phase psychological architecture derived from research on locker room speeches, rally cries, and pre-performance activation (see [psychology-and-rhetoric.md](./psychology-and-rhetoric.md) for the full research foundation).

The phases are designed to build from urgency through identity and dissonance to vivid future imagery, culminating in a single clear action command.

## The Five Phases

### Phase 1: Opening Urgency (10-15% of script)

**Purpose:** Establish temporal immediacy and override cognitive deliberation.

- Anchor to the present moment ("Right now", "This moment", "Today")
- Create time pressure that overrides hesitation
- Brief vulnerability/honesty for authenticity
- Frame: this moment is the critical inflection point

**Word allocation:** ~12% of total target words
**Psychological mechanism:** Urgency triggers dopamine/adrenaline release in the prefrontal cortex, forcing stimulus-driven action.

---

### Phase 2: Identity Activation (20-25% of script)

**Purpose:** Activate collective identity and shared values.

- Heavy use of "we/us/together" language
- Establish tribal belonging through shared values, not template repetition
- Reference what ambitious, high-performing people believe and do
- Build collective certainty from shared capability

**Word allocation:** ~23% of total target words
**Psychological mechanism:** Social identity activation creates neural synchronization among listeners, driving group-oriented performance motivation.

---

### Phase 3: Dissonance Creation (20-25% of script)

**Purpose:** Create psychological tension between self-concept and current state.

- Highlight gap between claimed identity and current performance
- Remove external justifications and excuses
- Surface the contradiction between values and current action
- Force internal resolution: who are you going to be RIGHT NOW?

**Word allocation:** ~23% of total target words
**Psychological mechanism:** Cognitive dissonance creates aversive psychological state that demands resolution through behavioral change, not rationalization.

---

### Phase 4: Vivid Future Imagery (20-25% of script)

**Purpose:** Transport the listener into a concrete experience of success.

- Use concrete, first-person sensory details specific to user's context
- Present tense to collapse psychological distance ("You ARE walking in...")
- Multiple senses: visual, kinesthetic, auditory
- Strategic anaphora for emotional crescendo

**Word allocation:** ~23% of total target words
**Psychological mechanism:** Mental imagery activates the same neural pathways as actual perceptual experience, enabling success rehearsal.

---

### Phase 5: Immediate Call to Action (10-15% of script)

**Purpose:** Channel all energy into one specific, achievable next step.

- ONE clear behavior, not a laundry list
- Remove all ambiguity about what to do next
- Action happens now or within minutes
- End with challenge that demands internal response

**Word allocation:** ~12% of total target words
**Psychological mechanism:** Specific behavioral direction prevents energy dissipation; singular focus maximizes execution.

## Duration Scaling

| Session Length | Total Words (170 WPM) | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Phase 5 |
|---------------|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 min (ultra) | ~170 words | ~20 | ~40 | ~40 | ~40 | ~30 |
| 3 min (quick) | ~510 words | ~60 | ~115 | ~115 | ~115 | ~60 |
| 6 min (standard) | ~1020 words | ~120 | ~235 | ~235 | ~235 | ~120 |
| 12 min (deep) | ~2040 words | ~245 | ~470 | ~470 | ~470 | ~245 |

**Speaking pace:** 160-180 words per minute (energizing mode), vs 140-160 WPM for calming scripts.

## Ultra-Quick Adaptation (1 minute)

For ultra-quick sessions, compress all 5 elements into ultra-concise statements:

1. **Immediate Urgency** (~20 words): Hit them NOW
2. **Identity Trigger** (~40 words): "You're the kind of person who..."
3. **Gap Awareness** (~40 words): Show distance between identity and current state
4. **Victory Vision** (~40 words): Paint the win vividly
5. **Action Command** (~30 words): ONE instruction, zero ambiguity

No warm-up, no transitions. Start at maximum intensity. Every word counts.
