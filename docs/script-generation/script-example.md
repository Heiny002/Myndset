## Full Script Text

Listen. Right now, in this moment, you're standing at the edge of something big. **(build intensity)**

Not tomorrow. Not next week. RIGHT NOW.

And I need you to feel that. Feel the weight of this moment. Because in the next five minutes, we're going to transform how you walk into that room...

You know what separates the ones who dominate from the ones who just show up? **(direct challenge)**

It's not more talent. It's not more experience. It's the willingness to channel every ounce of nervous energy into pure, focused power.

And you... **(confident conviction)** you have that power.

---

We are not the ones who play it safe. **(rising energy)**
We are not the ones who hold back when it matters.
We are the ones who turn pressure into performance.
We are the ones who show them exactly what we're made of.

That's who we are. That's what we do. And that's what you're about to prove...

Think about every moment you've prepared for this. Every late night. Every revision. Every time you pushed through when you wanted to quit. All of that... it led to THIS moment.

And here's the truth you need to hear: **(confident conviction)**

You're ready. Not "almost ready." Not "as ready as you can be." You ARE ready. Right now.

---

But let me ask you something... **(direct challenge)**

You've been saying you want to crush this. You've been visualizing success. You've been preparing like your life depends on it.

But saying isn't the same as DOING. Planning isn't the same as EXECUTING.

The gap between those two things? That gap closes in the next 60 minutes. Not tomorrow. Not later. RIGHT NOW...

Feel that fire in your chest? That's not anxiety. That's rocket fuel. **(build intensity)**

Your body is flooding your system with everything you need to perform at your absolute peak. That elevated heart rate? That's your body saying "Let's GO."

Don't fight it. CHANNEL it.

---

Picture this with me... **(vivid imagery)**

Three hours from now. You've CRUSHED it. You walk out of that room and you KNOW—not hope, not think—you KNOW you dominated every single second.

See the look on your face. Pure confidence. Pure satisfaction. That feeling of "I KNEW I could do this."

Hear yourself thinking: "That was EXACTLY what I was meant to do."

Feel that surge in your chest. That's what's waiting for you. That exact feeling. And it starts the moment you step through that door...

We've been training for this. We've been building to this. And now it's time to DELIVER.

Because people like us? **(rising energy)**
We don't shrink when the lights come on.
We don't second-guess when it's time to perform.
We don't hold anything back when everything's on the line.

We step up. We show up. We DOMINATE...

And that's exactly what you're about to do.

---

When you walk into that room, here's what's going to happen: **(urgent command)**

You're going to own the space. Not "try to" own it. You're going to TAKE it.

Every word you speak is going to land with absolute conviction. Because you know your material inside and out. You've put in the work. You've earned this moment.

And when you feel that flash of nervousness—and you will—you're going to recognize it for what it is: proof that you care. Proof that this matters. And you're going to take that energy and drive it straight into your delivery...

Picture yourself right now. Standing in front of them. **(vivid imagery)**

Your voice is strong. Clear. Unwavering.

You're making eye contact. You're reading the room. You're adjusting in real-time because you're PRESENT. You're in the zone.

And they're leaning in. They're nodding. They're WITH you. Because your conviction is contagious. Your certainty creates their certainty...

This is what you were made for. This is your moment.

---

So here's what happens next: **(urgent command)**

The second this ends, you stand up. You take three deep breaths. And you step into that room like you OWN it.

Because you do.

No hesitation. No second-guessing. Pure. Focused. Action.

You've got this. Not "maybe." Not "hopefully."

You've GOT this...

Now go show them exactly who you are.

## Comparison: Energizing vs Calming

### What an ENERGIZING script does:
- ✅ Creates urgency and immediate action
- ✅ Uses present tense ("You ARE ready")
- ✅ Includes powerful repetition
- ✅ Maintains high energy throughout
- ✅ Ends with specific action step
- ✅ Faster pacing (170 WPM)

### What a CALMING script would do instead:
- ❌ "Allow yourself to settle into this moment..."
- ❌ "Gently notice your breath..."
- ❌ Long, contemplative pauses
- ❌ Focus on relaxation and release
- ❌ Slower pacing (145 WPM)
- ❌ Softer, gentler language throughout

## Usage Notes

This example demonstrates the **primary mode** for Myndset scripts. Unless a user explicitly requests a calming meditation, all scripts should follow this high-energy, motivational format.

The goal is not to calm or relax the user—it's to **activate them** for immediate performance.

Think of this as a coach's locker room speech, not a bedtime meditation.

## Testing Recommendations

When generating this script with ElevenLabs:

1. **Use a commanding voice** (deep, authoritative)
2. **Apply 1.1x speaking rate** for urgency
3. **Emphasize action words heavily**: NOW, GO, DOMINATE, CRUSH
4. **Build intensity** on repetitive "We are..." sequences
5. **Use brief pauses** (0.5-1s) to maintain momentum
6. **End with powerful conviction** on final line

Expected user response: Feeling energized, motivated, ready to take immediate action.

If the user feels calm or relaxed, the delivery needs more intensity.
