### Primary Source: An Insider's Guide to Sub-Modalities
- **Authors**: Bandler, R., & MacDonald, W.
- **Year**: 1988
- **Title**: An Insider's Guide to Sub-Modalities
- **Publisher**: Meta Publications, Capitola, California
- **URL**: https://www.amazon.com/Insiders-Guide-Sub-Modalities/dp/0916990222
- **Key Findings**: Bandler and MacDonald defined submodalities as "the fine distinctions we make in each representational system: the difference that makes a difference." The book systematized the observation that the emotional impact of any internal representation (memory, imagined future, belief) is encoded not in its content but in its sensory structure — brightness, distance, size, color, location, movement for visual; volume, pitch, tempo, location for auditory; intensity, temperature, pressure, texture for kinesthetic. By identifying and adjusting these structural parameters, the emotional impact of the representation can be dramatically altered without changing the content itself. The methodology emphasizes that very small incremental shifts in subjective structure can produce large changes in emotional response. The book includes 20 practical exercises and transcripts demonstrating the change process.

### Supporting Studies

**Mental Imagery in Emotion and Emotional Disorders (2010)**
- **Authors**: Holmes, E. A., & Mathews, A.
- **Year**: 2010
- **Title**: Mental Imagery in Emotion and Emotional Disorders
- **Journal**: Clinical Psychology Review, 30(3), 349-362
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20116915/
- **Key Findings**: Comprehensive review establishing that mental imagery has a "special relationship" with emotion that verbal processing does not share. Imagery evokes emotion through three pathways: (1) direct influence on emotional systems in the brain responsive to sensory signals, (2) overlap between imagery and perception processes leading to responding "as if" to real events, and (3) imagery's capacity to contact memories for emotional episodes. Critically, the review confirmed that imagery evokes significantly greater emotional responses than verbal representation of the same content, and that the perspective and vividness of imagery modulates its emotional impact. This provides direct scientific support for the NLP submodalities premise that the sensory parameters of internal representations (not just their content) determine their emotional effect.
- **Effect Size**: Experimental evidence confirming imagery produces greater emotional responses than verbal thought about identical content; perspective and vividness modulate effect magnitude

**Mental Imagery and Emotion: A Special Relationship? (2005)**
- **Authors**: Holmes, E. A., & Mathews, A.
- **Year**: 2005
- **Title**: Mental Imagery and Emotion: A Special Relationship?
- **Journal**: Emotion, 5(4), 489-497
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16366752/
- **Key Findings**: Experimental study comparing imagery-based versus verbal-based processing of emotional scenarios. Participants who processed negative scenarios as mental images experienced significantly greater increases in anxiety than those who processed the same scenarios verbally. Conversely, imagery-based processing of positive scenarios produced greater positive emotional shifts. This directly supports the submodalities principle: the modality of representation (and by extension, its sensory parameters) determines the intensity of emotional response. The finding that manipulating the "how" of mental representation changes the "what" of emotional experience is the scientific equivalent of the NLP submodalities claim.
- **Effect Size**: Significant interaction between imagery condition and emotional valence (p < .01); imagery produced both greater anxiety (negative scenarios) and greater positive affect (positive scenarios) compared to verbal processing

**Neurolinguistic Programming: A Systematic Review of the Effects on Health Outcomes (2012)**
- **Authors**: Sturt, J., Ali, S., Robertson, W., Metcalfe, D., Grove, A., Bourne, C., & Bridle, C.
- **Year**: 2012
- **Title**: Neurolinguistic Programming: A Systematic Review of the Effects on Health Outcomes
- **Journal**: British Journal of General Practice, 62(604), e757-e764
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3481516/
- **Key Findings**: Systematic review of 10 experimental NLP studies (5 RCTs, 5 pre-post). While the review found limited evidence overall, individual studies targeting anxiety disorders and phobias (conditions where submodality-based interventions are most commonly applied) showed small to moderate positive effects. The review noted that the limitation is in research quantity and quality, not in evidence of harm. NLP interventions including submodality techniques were applied to anxiety, phobia, and claustrophobia with some positive outcomes in individual studies.
- **Effect Size**: Small to moderate positive effects in individual studies on anxiety and phobia; insufficient data for pooled analysis

- **Year**: 2019
- **Title**: The Applications of Neuro-Linguistic Programming in Organizational Settings: A Systematic Review of Psychological Outcomes
- **Journal**: Human Resource Development Quarterly, 30(1), 101-116
- **URL**: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hrdq.21334
- **Key Findings**: PRISMA-guided systematic review found that NLP techniques showed positive effects on psychological well-being and workplace performance in organizational settings. Submodality techniques were referenced as tools for rapid state change and emotional regulation in coaching contexts. The review noted positive outcomes but qualified them with concerns about methodological rigor in available studies.
- **Effect Size**: Positive trends across included studies; heterogeneity precluded formal meta-analysis

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
1. Submodalities work is a rapid change technique, not a long-term therapeutic modality on its own
2. The practitioner must first elicit the client's current submodality structure before attempting change
3. Changes should be made incrementally to maintain client comfort and control
4. The client maintains control throughout — they are adjusting their own internal experience
5. Always establish what the client wants to change and what they want instead before beginning
6. Test changes by having the client access the modified representation to verify the shift
7. Some submodalities are "drivers" (changing them changes everything) while others are less impactful — identify drivers first

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Elicitation and Calibration (60-90 seconds)**
1. Identify the target experience: a fear, a limiting memory, a weakened motivation, or an unwanted emotional response
2. Ask the client to bring the experience to mind and hold it as a mental image
3. Systematically elicit current submodality structure using the checklist:
   - Visual: Brightness? Color or black-and-white? Size? Distance? Location in visual field? Movie or still? Associated or dissociated? Focused or blurry?
   - Auditory: Volume? Pitch? Tempo? Direction? Internal or external? Whose voice?
   - Kinesthetic: Location in body? Intensity? Temperature? Movement? Pressure?
4. Note which submodalities are most prominent for this client

**Phase 2: Contrastive Analysis (30-60 seconds)**
1. Ask the client to think of a similar but positive/neutral version of the experience
2. Elicit the submodality structure of this positive representation
3. Compare the two structures side by side
4. Identify the key differences — these are the "driver" submodalities that encode the emotional distinction
5. Common drivers: distance (far = less emotional), size (smaller = less intense), brightness (dimmer = less vivid), association/dissociation (dissociated = less emotional)

**Phase 3: Submodality Shifts (60-120 seconds)**
1. Guide the client back to the unwanted representation
2. Begin adjusting the identified driver submodalities one at a time
3. "Take that image and push it further away... notice what happens to the feeling..."
4. "Now make it dimmer... smaller... drain the color out..."
5. "Notice how the feeling changes as you adjust these qualities..."
6. If the emotional intensity increases (wrong direction), reverse the shift and try a different submodality
7. Continue until the emotional impact is significantly reduced or transformed

**Phase 4: Amplification of Desired State (60-90 seconds)**
1. Now bring to mind the desired state, motivation, or positive resource
2. Adjust submodalities in the opposite direction: brighter, closer, larger, more vivid, more colorful
3. "Make this image bigger and brighter... step into it... turn up the feelings..."
4. "Notice how much more compelling this becomes as you adjust these qualities..."
5. The goal is to make the desired state more neurologically compelling than the old pattern

**Phase 5: Testing and Future Pacing (30-60 seconds)**
1. Ask the client to try to access the old representation as it was before
2. If the change has held, the old pattern will feel different, more distant, or harder to access
3. If it returns to its original structure, repeat the shift process with stronger adjustments
4. Future pace: "Imagine a time in the future when you would have normally felt [old feeling]... notice what's different now..."

### Contraindications
- Active psychosis or severe dissociative disorders where internal representations may not be under volitional control
- Trauma memories that require specialized trauma-focused treatment (EMDR, PE, CPT) rather than submodality manipulation
- Clients who are unable to form or manipulate mental imagery (aphantasia)
- Situations where emotional responses are adaptive and appropriate (e.g., grief that needs processing, not suppressing)
- Individuals in acute emotional crisis without sufficient cognitive stability for the technique

### Cautions
- Not all clients are equally visual; adapt to their dominant representational system
- Submodality changes may feel temporary initially; reinforcement and repetition strengthen the change
- Avoid using submodality techniques to suppress emotions that need to be processed therapeutically
- Some clients may experience unexpected emotional intensification when first accessing internal representations
- The technique works best on specific discrete experiences, not generalized abstract states
- Monitor for ecological concerns: removing fear of a genuinely dangerous situation is contraindicated

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"Bring that memory to mind now... and as you see it, notice whether it's in color or black and white... How big is it? Where is it located in your visual field?... And how far away does it seem? Now I want you to slowly push that image further away from you... watch it get smaller... dimmer... drain the color out of it until it's a faded, distant black-and-white snapshot... and notice what happens to the feeling in your body as you do that... Good. Now let that fade away completely. And bring to mind a time when you felt deeply motivated and driven... See that image right in front of you, big and bright and vivid... step into it... make the colors richer, the image larger, closer... feel it in your body... and notice how much more compelling that feels..."

### Specific Language Patterns

1. **Elicitation Probe**: "As you see that image, how bright is it? How close? How large? Where exactly is it in your visual field?"
2. **Distance Shift**: "Push that image further away... watch it recede into the distance... getting smaller and smaller..."
3. **Brightness Adjustment**: "Now dim that image down... like turning a dimmer switch... until it's barely visible..."
4. **Color Drain**: "Let all the color drain out of that image... watch it become a faded black-and-white photograph..."
5. **Association/Dissociation**: "Step out of that image now... see yourself in it, as if watching a movie of someone else..."
6. **Amplification**: "Make it bigger, brighter, closer... turn up the colors... step fully into it..."
7. **Kinesthetic Shift**: "Notice where that feeling is in your body... now imagine moving it... changing its temperature... its intensity..."
8. **Testing**: "Now try to bring back the old image the way it was before... notice what's different..."
9. **Future Pace**: "Imagine a future situation where you would have felt that old response... what happens now?"
10. **Driver Identification**: "Which of these changes has the biggest effect on how you feel about it?"

### Milton Model Elements
- **Presupposition**: "As you notice the image shifting..." (presupposes the shift is occurring)
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can PUSH IT FURTHER AWAY and notice the change..."
- **Comparative Deletion**: "It's becoming less intense..." (less than what is unspecified, encouraging change)
- **Mind Reading**: "And you're probably noticing how the feeling is already beginning to change..."
- **Temporal Presupposition**: "After you've adjusted the brightness, you'll notice..."
- **Cause-Effect**: "The further away it gets, the less impact it has on you..."
- **Nominalization**: "That sense of distance... that fading... allows a transformation to occur..."

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Calm, confident, and exploratory during elicitation; more directive and energized during shifts
- **Pacing**: Slow during elicitation (allow client to access and describe internal experience); moderate during shifts (maintain momentum without rushing)
- **Volume**: Moderate; drop slightly when guiding diminishment of unwanted states; increase slightly when amplifying desired states
- **Emphasis**: Mark shift commands clearly: "PUSH it further away," "make it BRIGHTER"
- **Pauses**: 3-5 seconds after each elicitation question; 2-3 seconds between shift instructions to allow processing
- **Duration**: Full submodality intervention: 8-15 minutes; audio-guided version: 4-6 minutes focusing on a single target experience
- **Rhythm**: Conversational and interactive during elicitation; more rhythmic and flowing during guided shifts

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Emerging
- **Rationale**: The NLP submodalities framework predates but is directly supported by Holmes and Mathews' (2005, 2010) research demonstrating that mental imagery has a "special relationship" with emotion, that imagery parameters (perspective, vividness) modulate emotional impact, and that imagery evokes significantly greater emotional responses than verbal processing of identical content. These findings provide independent academic validation of the core submodalities premise: the sensory structure of internal representations determines their emotional effect. However, the specific NLP submodality change protocols (mapping across, contrastive analysis, driver identification) have not been subjected to rigorous controlled trials as isolated techniques. The broader NLP systematic reviews (Sturt et al., 2012; Kotera et al., 2019) show limited but not negative evidence, with individual studies showing positive effects on anxiety and phobia.

**Strengths**:
1. Core premise (imagery parameters modulate emotion) independently validated by Holmes and Mathews (2005, 2010)
2. Neuroscience confirms imagery activates same brain regions as perception, supporting "as if" emotional response
3. Rapid application: changes can occur within minutes when effective
4. Client-controlled: the individual maintains agency over their internal experience
5. Compatible with broader cognitive-behavioral approaches to emotional regulation

**Limitations**:
1. No isolated RCTs on the specific NLP submodality change protocol
2. Relies on client's ability to access and manipulate mental imagery (not universal)
3. Broader NLP research base is methodologically limited
4. Long-term durability of submodality changes not well studied
5. Mechanism may overlap significantly with standard cognitive restructuring and exposure techniques

## Additional Notes

### Historical Context
- Submodalities were first identified by Richard Bandler in the early 1980s as an extension of the NLP representational systems model
- The concept was systematized in Bandler and MacDonald's 1988 work and subsequently developed into specific change techniques
- Key submodality-based techniques include the Swish Pattern, Mapping Across, Compulsion Blowout, and Belief Change
- The concept parallels earlier work in cognitive psychology on mental imagery (Kosslyn, 1980) and image-based emotional processing

### Connection to Cognitive Science
Holmes and Mathews' research program provides the strongest scientific bridge between NLP submodalities and mainstream cognitive science. Their demonstration that imagery perspective, vividness, and processing mode modulate emotional response is essentially the same claim as the NLP submodalities model, expressed in different theoretical language. The convergence suggests that NLP practitioners and cognitive scientists independently identified the same phenomena through different methodologies.

### Common Driver Submodalities
From practitioner experience, the most common "driver" submodalities (those with the greatest emotional leverage) are:
- **Distance**: Moving images further away consistently reduces emotional intensity
- **Association/Dissociation**: Stepping out of an image (dissociating) dramatically reduces emotional impact
- **Size**: Smaller images produce less emotional response
- **Brightness**: Dimmer images feel less intense
- **Movement**: Still images feel less threatening than movies

### Audio Application Considerations
In audio-only delivery:
- Guide the listener through a specific experience they want to change
- Use permissive language since you cannot observe their responses
- Provide a systematic checklist of submodality adjustments to try
- Focus on the most commonly effective shifts: distance, brightness, size, association/dissociation
- Include pauses for the listener to make internal adjustments
- Test changes by asking them to notice the difference in feeling
