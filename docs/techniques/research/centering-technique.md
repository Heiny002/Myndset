### Primary Source: Attentional Control Theory and the Centering Protocol
- **Authors**: Nideffer, R. M.
- **Year**: 1976 (foundational theory); 1993 (centering protocol)
- **Title**: Test of Attentional and Interpersonal Style (1976); Concentration and Attention Control Training (1993)
- **Journal**: Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 34, 394-404 (1976); In J. M. Williams (Ed.), Applied Sport Psychology: Personal Growth to Peak Performance (1993)

- **Key Findings**: Nideffer's model identifies two dimensions of attention: width (broad vs. narrow) and direction (internal vs. external), producing four attentional styles. Centering redirects an athlete's focus from anxious internal-broad rumination to a calm internal-narrow awareness of the body's centre of gravity, then outward to task-relevant external cues. This attentional shift reduces cognitive interference and facilitates automatic motor execution.
- **Effect Size**: Theoretical framework; validated through the Test of Attentional and Interpersonal Style (TAIS) across multiple populations

- **URL**: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1750984X.2021.1944271
- **Key Findings**: Meta-analysis of pre-performance routines (PPRs) that frequently include centering elements (deep breathing, attentional focus shift) found significant positive effects on sport performance. PPRs were effective under both low-pressure and pressurised conditions. Even brief PPR learning (as little as 10 minutes) produced measurable effects, consistent with centering's rapid deployment design.
- **Effect Size**: Pre-post designs SMC = 0.31, 95% CI [0.18, 0.44]; Experimental designs under low pressure g = 0.64, 95% CI [0.45, 0.83]; Under pressure g = 0.70

- **URL**: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00874/full
- **Key Findings**: Randomised controlled trial of 20 sessions of diaphragmatic breathing training. The breathing group showed significantly decreased negative affect (p < 0.05) and sustained attention improvements compared to controls. Cortisol levels were significantly reduced post-intervention. These findings support the diaphragmatic breathing component central to the centering technique.
- **Effect Size**: Significant group x time interaction for cortisol reduction and sustained attention (p < 0.05)

- **Key Findings**: Chapter 8 presents the full centering protocol adapted from martial arts. Nideffer combines diaphragmatic breathing with cue words ("Balanced," "Fluid," "Confident," "Focused") to re-centre athletes. The technique is designed to instil feelings of emotional control by directing attention to the body's centre of mass (one to two inches below and behind the navel), producing feelings of being grounded, calm, and receptive.

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From Nideffer's Attentional Control Training and Don Greene's Adaptation:**
1. Centering should be used as a brief pre-performance intervention (30 seconds to 2 minutes)
2. The technique is most effective when practised daily during training, not only before competition
3. Centering combines physical (breath, posture, centre of gravity) and psychological (cue words, attentional shift) components
4. Athletes should be taught to recognise their own signs of attentional misdirection or over-arousal
5. The technique is adaptable across all sports, performing arts, and high-pressure professional contexts
6. Centering is a component of broader Attentional Control Training (ACT)

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Postural Foundation**
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly flexed, weight evenly distributed
2. Relax shoulders down and back; align head over spine
3. If seated, plant both feet flat on the floor, sit upright without rigidity
4. Establish a stable physical base from which the mental technique operates

**Phase 2: Focal Point Selection**
1. Choose a specific external point to focus on initially (a spot on the ground, equipment, target)
2. This external anchor prevents the mind from wandering during the centering process
3. Allow the eyes to soften slightly while maintaining external focus

**Phase 3: Diaphragmatic Breath and Centre of Gravity Drop**
1. Inhale slowly and deeply through the nose, directing the breath into the belly (diaphragm)
2. As you exhale slowly through the mouth, consciously direct attention downward to the body's centre of mass -- one to two inches below and behind the navel
3. Feel the body settling and grounding with each exhale
4. Allow any tension to flow downward and out through the feet
5. Take 2-3 centering breaths in this manner

**Phase 4: Tension Scan and Release**
1. Briefly scan the body from head to feet, identifying areas of tension
2. On each exhale, consciously release tension from identified areas
3. Common tension sites: jaw, shoulders, forearms, hip flexors
4. This step ensures the body is physically prepared for fluid movement

**Phase 5: Cue Word Activation and Attentional Redirect**
1. On the final centering breath, silently say a personal cue word (e.g., "Focused," "Ready," "Smooth")
2. Shift attention from internal awareness to the specific external task demands
3. Direct energy and focus toward the performance target
4. Execute the skill with full commitment

### Contraindications
- **Panic Disorder**: Deliberate focus on breathing may paradoxically increase anxiety in individuals with panic disorder; consult clinical psychologist
- **Dissociative Conditions**: Internal body-focus may trigger dissociative episodes in vulnerable individuals
- **Acute Hyperventilation**: Athletes currently hyperventilating should be stabilised before attempting centering
- **Severe Trauma History**: Body-focused attention may be distressing for individuals with somatic trauma responses

### Cautions
- Initial practice may feel unnatural; athletes should allow 2-4 weeks of daily practice before expecting automatic deployment
- Centering is not a substitute for adequate physical preparation, technical skill development, or clinical treatment
- Overemphasis on the breathing component can inadvertently disrupt natural breathing patterns in some athletes
- Should be personalised; the specific cue words and focal points must be meaningful to the individual
- May need adaptation for sport-specific postures (e.g., swimmers on the blocks, cyclists in aero position)

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"Stand tall, feet grounded, shoulders relaxed. Now pick a spot in front of you and let your eyes settle there. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose -- feel your belly expand. As you exhale, let your attention drop down to your centre, that point just below your navel. Feel yourself settling, grounding, becoming solid. Take one more breath, and as you exhale, let any tension drain out through your feet. Now, silently say your word -- 'Ready' -- and direct your focus forward to exactly where you need it. You are centred. Go."

- **Source**: Adapted from Nideffer's centering protocol and Don Greene's seven-step centering process
- **Context**: Used immediately before a performance moment (serve, free throw, presentation)

### Specific Language Patterns

**Grounding Patterns:**
1. "Feel your feet connected to the ground beneath you..."
2. "Let your weight settle evenly through both legs..."
3. "Notice the solid foundation you're standing on..."

**Breath Direction Patterns:**
4. "Breathe down into your belly, not up into your chest..."
5. "As you exhale, let your awareness drop to your centre..."
6. "Feel the breath filling the space just below your navel..."

**Release Patterns:**
7. "Let any tension drain downward and out through the soles of your feet..."
8. "With each exhale, feel your body softening, settling, becoming fluid..."

**Activation Patterns:**
9. "Now say your word and direct all your energy to the target..."
10. "You are grounded. You are centred. Now focus forward and execute."

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can begin to feel yourself settling into your centre NOW..."
- **Presuppositions**: "As you find your centre..." (presupposes they will find it)
- **Kinaesthetic Predicates**: "Feel yourself grounding... sense the weight dropping... notice the solidity..."
- **Temporal Predicates**: "In a moment, when you're fully centred, you'll direct your focus outward..."

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Calm, grounded, and steady -- the practitioner's voice should model the centred state being elicited
- **Pacing**: Deliberately slow, especially during the breathing phase; match the rhythm of the athlete's breath
- **Emphasis**: Lower the pitch and slow the pace when directing attention to the centre of gravity; increase energy subtly during the final activation/redirect phase
- **Duration**: 1-2 minutes for full guided centering; 15-30 seconds for experienced self-centering
- **Volume**: Moderate to quiet throughout; avoid any sudden or jarring vocal shifts that would disrupt the settling process

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Pre-performance focus, anxiety regulation, attentional control under pressure, arousal management
- **Target Audience**: Athletes across all sports (especially self-paced tasks), performing musicians, military and law enforcement, surgeons, executives, public speakers
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Pre-serve routine in tennis
  - Free throw preparation in basketball
  - Pre-shot routine in golf
  - Pre-pitch focus in baseball
  - Before a musical performance or audition
  - Before a high-stakes business presentation or negotiation
  - Military and tactical readiness before deployment
  - Surgeon preparation before entering the operating theatre
  - Refocusing between points, plays, or critical moments during competition

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Strong
- **Rationale**: The centering technique rests on Nideffer's (1976) attentional control theory, which has been validated across multiple populations using the TAIS instrument. The diaphragmatic breathing component is supported by randomised controlled trials showing reduced cortisol, improved sustained attention, and decreased negative affect (Ma et al., 2017). The meta-analysis by Rupprecht et al. (2021) demonstrates that pre-performance routines incorporating centering elements produce moderate-to-large effects on sport performance (g = 0.64-0.70), even under pressurised conditions. The technique has been widely adopted across elite sport, performing arts, and military settings over four decades. While no single large-scale RCT tests centering in isolation, the convergent evidence from attentional theory, breathing research, and pre-performance routine meta-analyses provides a strong evidence base.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Development
- Centering originates from martial arts traditions, particularly Aikido, where practitioners direct awareness to their hara (centre of gravity)
- Adopted by sport psychologist Robert Nideffer in the mid-1970s as part of his Attentional Control Training framework
- Formalised in Nideffer's 1992 book Psyched to Win (Chapter 8)
- Adapted for performing artists by Dr. Don Greene, who expanded the protocol into a seven-step process for musicians, actors, and dancers
- Now used by the US Olympic Committee, professional sports teams, military special operations, and performing arts conservatories worldwide

### Seven-Step Centering Process (Don Greene's Adaptation)
1. **Pick a focal point** -- choose an external visual anchor
2. **Form a clear intention** -- set a specific performance goal
3. **Breathe mindfully** -- diaphragmatic breath to lower arousal
4. **Scan and release tension** -- progressive body scan
5. **Find your centre** -- direct awareness to centre of gravity
6. **Repeat a process cue** -- personal trigger word
7. **Direct your energy** -- channel focus to the performance target

### Practical Considerations
- Athletes should practice centering 50-100 times in training before relying on it in competition
- The technique can be shortened to a single breath + cue word once mastered
- Can be performed with eyes open or closed depending on the sport context
- Physical position can be adapted (standing, seated, supine) to match sport demands
- Team version: entire squad centres together before taking the field for collective focus
