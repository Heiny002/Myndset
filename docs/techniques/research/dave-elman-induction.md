### Primary Source: HypMol Randomized Controlled Trial
- **Authors**: Wolf, T. G., et al.
- **Year**: 2022
- **Title**: Effectiveness of a Brief Hypnotic Induction in Third Molar Extraction: A Randomized Controlled Trial (HypMol)
- **Journal**: The Journal of Pain, 23(6), 1065-1076
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35108620/
- **Key Findings**: Monocentric randomized crossover trial with 33 patients undergoing bilateral third molar extractions. One side received reduced local anesthetic plus Dave Elman brief hypnotic induction; other side received standard care. Brief hypnotic induction did not generally reduce post-treatment pain compared to standard local anesthetics. However, patients with high expectations about hypnosis showed significantly greater benefit from the Elman induction, demonstrating expectancy as a moderator variable.
- **Effect Size**: No significant overall difference in area under the curve for pain; significant interaction effect for patient expectancy (high-expectancy patients showed clinically meaningful benefit)

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From Elman's Hypnotherapy (1964) and Contemporary Training Sources:**
1. The Elman Induction is designed for rapid trance induction, typically achieving somnambulism within 2-4 minutes
2. It follows a structured, sequential process with clear compliance tests at each stage
3. The practitioner must calibrate to the subject's responses and not advance until each phase is confirmed
4. The technique assumes voluntary participation; it does not work against the subject's will
5. Elman taught that most people can achieve somnambulism, making this induction broadly applicable
6. The induction should be delivered with authority and confidence, but not in an authoritarian manner
7. Originally developed for use by physicians and dentists; now widely used in therapeutic and performance contexts

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Eye Closure and Eye Catalepsy**
1. Instruct the subject to close their eyes
2. Direct them to relax the muscles around the eyes so completely that the eye muscles will not work
3. Emphasize: "Relax them to the point where, as long as you hold onto that relaxation, they just won't work"
4. Test: "When you're sure they're so relaxed they won't work, test them, try to open them"
5. Confirm the eyes remain closed (eye catalepsy achieved)
6. This establishes the first compliance frame and demonstrates the subject's ability to control relaxation

**Phase 2: Fractionation (Deepening Through Repetition)**
1. Instruct: "Now let that relaxation spread from the top of your head to the tips of your toes"
2. Say: "In a moment I'm going to have you open and close your eyes. Each time you close them, double your relaxation"
3. Count: "Open... close... double that relaxation. Good. Open... close... double it again"
4. Repeat 2-3 times, using fractionation principle (each cycle deepens the trance)
5. Each eye opening and closing creates a micro-arousal followed by deeper relaxation
6. The doubling suggestion compounds the relaxation exponentially

**Phase 3: Arm Drop (Physical Relaxation Test)**
1. Lift the subject's hand/arm gently by the wrist
2. Say: "In a moment I'm going to pick up your hand and drop it. If you've followed my releasing instructions, that hand will be completely limp and loose and will just plop down"
3. Drop the hand; it should fall limply without resistance
4. If the hand resists or is placed down deliberately, re-suggest relaxation and repeat
5. This tests and deepens physical relaxation and confirms trance compliance

**Phase 4: Mental Relaxation and Number Disappearance (Somnambulism Test)**
1. Say: "Now I'd like you to begin relaxing your mind. In a moment I'll ask you to slowly count backwards from 100"
2. Instruct: "With each number you say, double your mental relaxation. By the time you reach 97, or sooner, those numbers will simply disappear from your mind"
3. Subject begins: "100... 99... 98..."
4. After each number, suggest: "Doubling that mental relaxation... letting those numbers fade away..."
5. When the subject hesitates, stops, or reports the numbers are gone, somnambulism is achieved
6. Confirm: "Are those numbers all gone?" -- A "yes" confirms somnambulistic depth

**Phase 5: Utilization (Transition to Therapeutic/Performance Work)**
1. With somnambulism confirmed, transition to the therapeutic or performance intervention
2. The subject is now in a highly suggestible state suitable for direct suggestion, visualization, ego strengthening, or other hypnotic techniques
3. Duration of this working phase varies based on the specific application
4. When complete, use a standard emergence procedure, counting up from 1 to 5 with suggestions of alertness and well-being

### Contraindications
- **Acute Psychotic Episodes**: Hypnosis should not be used during active psychosis or severe dissociative states
- **Severe Untreated Mental Illness**: Not appropriate as a standalone intervention for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder in acute phase, or severe personality disorders without psychiatric supervision
- **Seizure Disorders**: Eye fixation and rapid state changes may pose theoretical risk; consult neurologist
- **Traumatic Brain Injury (Acute)**: Altered consciousness states may complicate assessment
- **Refusal or Extreme Fear**: The technique requires voluntary participation; forcing or pressuring compromises safety and ethics
- **Substance Intoxication**: Altered baseline consciousness prevents reliable trance work

### Cautions
- Subject must be screened for psychiatric contraindications before any hypnotic procedure
- The number disappearance test (Phase 4) can occasionally produce anxiety in highly analytical individuals; practitioner should normalize the experience
- Some subjects may experience transient disorientation upon emergence; allow adequate re-orientation time
- Practitioner should have training in both induction and proper emergence procedures
- Audio-only delivery (without visual calibration) requires additional verbal check-ins for compliance confirmation
- The rapid nature of the induction may not suit individuals who need more gradual relaxation approaches
- Post-session debriefing recommended to process the experience and reinforce positive outcomes

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"Now close your eyes. I'd like you to relax every muscle and every nerve around your eyes. Relax them so completely that they just won't work. When you're certain you've relaxed them to the point where, as long as you hold onto that relaxation, they simply won't open... go ahead and test them. Try to open them. Notice that they remain comfortably closed. That's right. Now stop trying and let that wonderful wave of relaxation spread from the top of your head, all the way down to the tips of your toes. In a moment I'll have you open and close your eyes. Each time you close them, just double your relaxation. Ready? Open... close... and double that relaxation. Wonderful."

- **Source**: Adapted from Dave Elman's Hypnotherapy (1964) and contemporary Elman training scripts
- **Context**: Opening phase of the induction, establishing eye catalepsy and beginning fractionation
- **Duration**: This excerpt covers approximately the first 60-90 seconds of the 3-minute induction

### Specific Language Patterns

1. **Relaxation directive**: "Relax every muscle and every nerve around your eyes, so completely that they just won't work."
2. **Conditional test**: "As long as you hold onto that relaxation, those eyes will remain closed."
3. **Compliance test**: "Go ahead and test them... try to open them."
4. **Doubling suggestion**: "Each time you close your eyes, double your relaxation."
5. **Spreading relaxation**: "Let that wave of relaxation flow from the top of your head to the tips of your toes."
6. **Number disappearance**: "With each number you say, double your mental relaxation until those numbers simply disappear."
7. **Confirmation check**: "Are those numbers all gone now?"
8. **Limpness suggestion**: "That hand will be completely limp and loose, like a wet dishcloth."
9. **Deepening presupposition**: "Going deeper and deeper with every breath you take."
10. **Transition to utilization**: "Now that your mind is clear and quiet, you're ready to make powerful changes."

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can RELAX COMPLETELY now as you CLOSE YOUR EYES and LET GO."
- **Presuppositions**: "When you notice how deep that relaxation has become..." (presupposes depth has been achieved)
- **Temporal Predicates**: "By the time you reach 97, or sooner, those numbers will disappear."
- **Pacing and Leading**: "You've closed your eyes, you're sitting comfortably, and now that relaxation is beginning to double..."
- **Truisms**: "Everyone knows how to relax. You've been doing it your whole life."
- **Binds**: "You can go into trance quickly, or you can go into trance very quickly."
- **Analogical Marking**: Lowered voice tone and slower pace on key command words (relax, deeper, let go, disappear)

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Calm, authoritative, and confident throughout. Not commanding in an aggressive sense, but clearly directing the process with certainty
- **Pacing**: Moderate pace for instructions; slow and deliberate during relaxation suggestions; brisk and matter-of-fact during compliance tests
- **Emphasis**: Mark the test moments ("try to open them") with clear, firm vocal quality; soften for relaxation deepening
- **Volume**: Steady moderate volume; slightly quieter during deepening phases; normal conversational tone during tests
- **Rhythm**: The doubling/fractionation phase should have a rhythmic quality -- "Open... close... double. Open... close... double"
- **Timing**: Total induction runs 2-4 minutes. Eye catalepsy: 30-45 seconds. Fractionation: 30-45 seconds. Arm drop: 15-30 seconds. Number disappearance: 45-90 seconds
- **Confidence**: Elman emphasized that the practitioner's certainty is communicated nonverbally; hesitation in delivery undermines the induction

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Rapid trance induction when time efficiency is critical; pre-performance mental preparation; clinical hypnotherapy where multiple sessions require consistent, reliable trance access
- **Target Audience**: Athletes needing quick pre-competition mental preparation, executives before high-stakes presentations, performers before going on stage, dental/medical patients requiring rapid anxiety reduction, coaching clients seeking efficient hypnotic interventions
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Pre-competition rapid trance for athletes (2-3 minute induction followed by performance visualization)
  - Clinical hypnotherapy sessions requiring reliable somnambulistic depth
  - Dental and medical procedure anxiety reduction
  - Pre-presentation confidence and calm installation for executives
  - Habit change interventions (smoking cessation, weight management) requiring deep trance
  - Pain management in clinical and sport contexts
  - Rapid stress reduction in time-limited coaching sessions

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Moderate
- **Rationale**: The Dave Elman Induction benefits from the broader evidence base for clinical hypnosis, which is substantial. The Milling et al. (2023) umbrella review of 49 meta-analyses confirms hypnosis as effective across multiple applications with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. The HypMol RCT (Wolf et al., 2022) is the only published randomized controlled trial specifically studying the Elman technique, finding significant expectancy moderation effects. Barker & Jones (2010) demonstrated hypnosis effectiveness for sport performance. Foa et al. (2022) reviewed hypnosis in sport, supporting rapid induction approaches. The Elman Induction itself is one of the most widely taught and practiced induction methods in professional hypnotherapy training worldwide, with extensive clinical experience spanning over 60 years. The structured, testable nature of each phase (eye catalepsy, fractionation, arm drop, number disappearance) provides built-in calibration that increases reliability. Evidence is rated moderate rather than strong because most hypnosis RCTs do not specify which induction method was used, making it difficult to attribute outcomes specifically to the Elman protocol versus hypnosis generally.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Development
- Dave Elman (1900-1967) was a radio host and stage performer who became one of the most influential hypnosis educators in American history
- His book "Hypnotherapy" (1964) documented his teaching methodology and became a foundational text in professional hypnosis training
- Elman trained thousands of physicians and dentists in rapid hypnotic induction, emphasizing practical clinical application over theoretical debate
- His approach emphasized that hypnosis is a natural state and that most people can achieve somnambulism with proper guidance
- The induction was revolutionary for its speed: 2-4 minutes compared to the 20-40 minute progressive relaxation inductions common in his era
- The technique was further refined by Cal Banyan into the "Elman-Banyan Induction" which adds additional deepening techniques

### Relationship to Other Techniques
- **Progressive Relaxation Induction**: Elman's approach is faster and more directive; progressive relaxation is gentler but slower (15-30 minutes)
- **Post-Hypnotic Suggestion**: The Elman Induction creates the trance state; post-hypnotic suggestions are delivered during the utilization phase
- **Embedded Commands**: Can be woven into the Elman script to enhance suggestibility during induction
- **NLP Anchoring/Stacking**: The trance state achieved via Elman induction can serve as the context for installing or stacking NLP anchors
- **Mental Imagery/Visualization**: Commonly used in the utilization phase after Elman induction achieves somnambulism
- **Ego Strengthening**: Frequently paired with Elman induction in clinical practice

### Key Distinguishing Features
- **Speed**: 2-4 minutes to somnambulism vs. 20-40 minutes for traditional methods
- **Testability**: Each phase includes a built-in compliance test (eye catalepsy, arm drop, number disappearance)
- **Structured**: Clear sequential phases that can be taught and replicated consistently
- **Depth**: Designed to achieve somnambulism (deepest working state), not just light trance
- **Versatility**: Used in clinical, dental, medical, sport, and performance contexts
