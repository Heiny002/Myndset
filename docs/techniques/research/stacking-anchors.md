- **Title**: Mood and Memory
- **Journal**: American Psychologist, 36(2), 129-148
- **URL**: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-31724-001
- **Key Findings**: Demonstrated that emotional states serve as memory contexts; subjects exhibited mood-state-dependent memory in recall tasks. Proposed Associative Network Theory of Memory and Emotion, showing that emotional states can be linked to stimuli and later re-accessed through associated triggers. This provides the core psychological mechanism underlying anchor stacking: layering multiple emotional states onto a single stimulus creates a compound associative network.
- **Effect Size**: Significant mood-congruent recall effects across multiple experiments

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From NLP Master Practitioner Training Sources:**
1. Stacking anchors should only be performed after the practitioner has mastered single-state anchoring
2. Each state layered onto the stack must be individually accessed at high intensity before anchoring
3. The same anchor point (kinesthetic, visual, or auditory) must be used consistently for all stacked states
4. States should be selected for complementarity (e.g., confidence + focus + determination) rather than contradiction
5. The anchor must be fired at peak intensity for each state being added to the stack
6. A clean break state must be induced between each layered state to prevent contamination
7. Best results occur when stacking 3-5 states; more than 5 may produce diminishing returns or diffusion

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: State Selection and Design**
1. Identify the performance context (e.g., sales presentation, athletic competition, creative session)
2. Determine 3-5 complementary resourceful states needed for peak performance in that context
3. Common stacking combinations:
   - Performance stack: confidence + focus + energy + determination
   - Creative stack: curiosity + playfulness + calm + flow
   - Leadership stack: authority + empathy + decisiveness + calm presence
4. Prioritize states from most to least important for the specific context

**Phase 2: Individual State Elicitation**
1. For each state in the stack, guide the client to recall a vivid, intense memory of experiencing that state
2. Use submodality amplification: make the internal image bigger, brighter, closer; sounds louder, clearer
3. Ensure the memory is fully associated (first person, seeing through own eyes)
4. Watch for physiological indicators: breathing changes, posture shifts, skin color changes, muscle tension
5. Allow each state to build to its absolute peak before anchoring

**Phase 3: Sequential Anchor Installation**
1. Access first state (e.g., confidence) to peak intensity
2. Fire anchor at peak (e.g., press thumb and index finger together firmly)
3. Hold anchor for 5-10 seconds while state is at peak
4. Release anchor and break state completely (ask unrelated question, change posture)
5. Access second state (e.g., focus) to peak intensity
6. Fire the SAME anchor at peak of second state
7. Hold, release, break state
8. Repeat for each additional state in the stack
9. Each layer compounds the anchor, creating a richer, more complex resource state

**Phase 4: Testing and Calibration**
1. After all states are stacked, break state completely
2. Fire the compound anchor
3. Observe whether multiple states activate simultaneously
4. Client should report feeling a blend of all stacked states
5. If any state is weak or missing, re-stack that specific state
6. Test in imagined performance scenarios through future pacing

**Phase 5: Reinforcement and Field Testing**
1. Have client fire the stacked anchor multiple times in session to strengthen
2. Assign homework: fire anchor 3-5 times daily in low-stakes situations
3. Gradually introduce anchor use in increasingly challenging real-world contexts
4. Schedule follow-up to assess durability and re-stack if needed
5. Teach client to self-maintain the anchor by periodically re-stacking

### Contraindications
- **Severe Mental Health Conditions**: Not suitable as primary treatment for clinical anxiety, PTSD, depression, or trauma without professional therapeutic supervision
- **Active Psychosis or Dissociative States**: Intensive state elicitation may be destabilizing
- **Recent Acute Trauma**: Accessing intense emotional states may trigger traumatic re-experiencing
- **Medication-Altered States**: Psychotropic medications may interfere with clean state access
- **Emotional Overwhelm**: If client cannot achieve controlled state access, stacking may produce confusion rather than a compound resource

### Cautions
- Requires mastery of basic anchoring before attempting stacking
- States must be genuinely experienced, not intellectualized; weak states produce weak anchors
- Contamination risk: if anchor is accidentally fired during negative states, the stack is compromised
- Overly complex stacks (6+ states) may produce vague or diluted responses
- Not a substitute for evidence-based psychotherapy for clinical conditions
- Effectiveness depends heavily on practitioner skill in state elicitation and calibration
- Limited peer-reviewed evidence specific to stacking (most NLP research addresses anchoring generally)

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"Now that you have that feeling of total confidence locked in, let's add another layer. Break state for me -- tell me what you had for breakfast... Good. Now I want you to think of a time when you were completely focused, when nothing could distract you, when your concentration was absolute. Step into that memory now. See what you saw. Hear what you heard. Feel that laser focus building... stronger and stronger... and right at that peak -- press your thumb and finger together again, right now -- stacking that focus directly on top of that confidence. Excellent. You're building a compound state that is more powerful than either state alone."

- **Source**: Adapted from NLP Master Practitioner training protocols
- **Context**: Used during the sequential stacking phase, transitioning from the first stacked state to the second
- **Duration**: Full stacking session runs 3-4 minutes per state, approximately 12-20 minutes total for a 3-5 state stack; rapid re-firing takes under 1 minute

### Specific Language Patterns

1. **Layering metaphor**: "We're building this anchor layer by layer, like adding colors to a painting, each one making the whole picture richer and more vivid."
2. **Compound state suggestion**: "Notice how these states blend together into something even more powerful than either one alone."
3. **Peak intensity command**: "Let that feeling build to its absolute peak... and right there -- fire that anchor NOW."
4. **Clean break directive**: "Shake that off completely. Tell me -- what's your phone number backwards?"
5. **Stacking transition**: "Beautiful. Now we're going to add the next layer. Think of a time when you felt unstoppable determination..."
6. **Amplification pattern**: "Make that image bigger, brighter, turn up the volume on those sounds, intensify those feelings by a factor of ten."
7. **Integration suggestion**: "All of these states are now wired together on that single trigger, ready to fire as one unified resource."
8. **Future pacing**: "Imagine yourself walking into that meeting next week, firing this anchor, and feeling all of these resources flooding through you simultaneously."
9. **Reinforcement loop**: "Every time you fire this anchor, it gets stronger. Every positive experience you have while the anchor is active adds to the stack automatically."
10. **Ownership transfer**: "This is YOUR resource now. You built it from your own experiences. You own it completely and can access it any time you choose."

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can begin to FEEL THAT CONFIDENCE NOW as each layer builds..."
- **Presuppositions**: "When you notice how much stronger this compound state feels..." (presupposes they will notice increased strength)
- **Temporal Predicates**: "As each new state is added, the anchor becomes more and more powerful..."
- **Pacing and Leading**: "You're pressing those fingers together, feeling that first state return, and now the second state is joining it..."
- **Nominalization**: "This integration of resources creates a transformation in your state..."
- **Tag Questions**: "You can feel that getting stronger, can't you?"
- **Analogical Marking**: Tonal emphasis on key state words (CONFIDENCE, FOCUS, POWER) during installation

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Authoritative and energized during state elicitation; calm and precise during anchor installation; matter-of-fact during break states
- **Pacing**: Build tempo during state access, slow and deliberate at anchor installation moment, normal conversational pace during breaks
- **Emphasis**: Mark the anchor firing moment with a distinct tonal shift -- deeper voice, slower cadence, increased intensity
- **Volume**: Gradually increase volume as state builds to peak; firm commanding tone at anchor installation; return to normal during breaks
- **Physicality**: If using kinesthetic anchors, ensure consistent pressure, location, and duration for each stack layer
- **Timing**: 3-4 minutes per state layer; full session 15-25 minutes; rapid re-fire under 5 seconds
- **Energy Management**: Practitioner must maintain high energy during elicitation phases; breaks serve dual purpose of resetting both client and practitioner

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Creating compound on-demand performance states for high-pressure situations requiring multiple psychological resources simultaneously
- **Target Audience**: Athletes preparing for competition, entrepreneurs pitching to investors, executives leading critical meetings, performers before going on stage, sales professionals before high-stakes calls
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Pre-competition state loading for athletes (confidence + focus + aggression + calm)
  - Pre-presentation resource activation for executives (authority + clarity + connection + calm)
  - Creative session priming for entrepreneurs (curiosity + courage + flow + persistence)
  - Pre-performance state management for musicians/actors (presence + joy + focus + relaxation)
  - Sales call preparation (rapport + confidence + persistence + empathy)

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Emerging
- **Rationale**: Stacking anchors is a specific extension of NLP anchoring, which itself has a moderate evidence base. The underlying psychological mechanisms are well-supported: classical conditioning (Pavlov), state-dependent memory (Bower, 1981), and emotional regulation through stimulus-response associations are established in mainstream psychology. The Zaharia et al. (2015) meta-analysis found a medium effect size (d = 0.54) for NLP therapy broadly, though stacking was not isolated as a variable. Kotera et al. (2019) found NLP effective for organizational psychological outcomes but noted methodological limitations in existing research. No randomized controlled trials specifically isolate stacking anchors as an independent variable. The technique is widely used in NLP Master Practitioner training and sport psychology consulting, with extensive practitioner reports of effectiveness, but rigorous controlled research on the compound stacking mechanism specifically remains lacking.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Development
- Anchoring was developed by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in the 1970s, derived from observing Milton Erickson's use of post-hypnotic triggers and Virginia Satir's therapeutic touch patterns
- Stacking anchors emerged as a natural extension during the development of advanced NLP techniques in the early 1980s
- The technique was formalized in NLP Master Practitioner curricula and published in works such as Bandler & Grinder's "Frogs into Princes" (1979) and Andreas & Andreas' "Heart of the Mind" (1989)
- Sport psychology practitioners adopted and adapted the technique for athletic performance enhancement

### Relationship to Other Techniques
- **Basic Anchoring**: Stacking is the advanced extension; requires mastery of single-state anchoring first
- **Collapsing Anchors**: Complementary technique that neutralizes negative states; stacking builds positive compound states
- **Circle of Excellence**: Uses spatial anchoring with stacking principles (step into circle while stacking states)
- **Swish Pattern**: Can be combined with stacked anchors for behavioral change applications
- **Mental Rehearsal/Visualization**: Often used alongside stacking to future-pace the compound state into upcoming performance situations

### Practical Considerations
- Kinesthetic anchors (touch-based) are most reliable for stacking due to precise replicability
- The "break state" between layers is critical; without it, states bleed together during elicitation rather than compounding cleanly at the anchor point
- Stacked anchors may need periodic maintenance (re-stacking every 2-4 weeks) depending on usage frequency
- Self-stacking (person creates own stack) is possible but typically less powerful than facilitator-guided stacking due to divided attention
- Audio-guided stacking is feasible for self-practice once the process is learned in person
