- **Journal**: Medical Decision Making, Volume 41, Pages 801-820
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8482297/
- **Key Findings**: From 30,648 records screened, 33 articles describing trials of 43 values clarification methods were identified. Explicit values clarification methods decreased the frequency of values-incongruent choices (risk difference, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.02; P < 0.001) and decisional conflict compared to control conditions. Multicriteria decision analysis led to more values-congruent decisions than other values clarification methods.
- **Effect Size**: Risk difference = -0.04 (95% CI: -0.06 to -0.02) for values-incongruent choices; statistically significant at P < 0.001

### Supporting Studies

**Self-Affirmation and Neuroendocrine Stress Buffering**
- **Authors**: J. David Creswell, William T. Welch, Shelley E. Taylor, David K. Sherman, Tara L. Gruenewald, Traci Mann
- **Year**: 2005
- **Title**: Affirmation of Personal Values Buffers Neuroendocrine and Psychological Stress Responses
- **Journal**: Psychological Science, Volume 16, Pages 846-851
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16262767/
- **Key Findings**: 85 participants completed either a value-affirmation task or a control task prior to a laboratory stress challenge. Value-affirmation participants had significantly lower cortisol responses 20, 30, and 45 minutes after stress onset. Control participants showed significant cortisol increases, whereas value-affirmation participants did not. Dispositional self-resources moderated the relation between value affirmation and psychological stress responses.
- **Effect Size**: Significant cortisol reduction at 20, 30, and 45 minutes post-stress onset (P < 0.05); moderated by trait self-esteem and optimism

- **Year**: 2013
- **Title**: Values Are Not Just Goals: Online ACT-Based Values Training Adds to Goal Setting in Improving Undergraduate College Student Performance
- **Journal**: Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science, Volume 2, Pages 79-84
- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212144713000252
- **Key Findings**: Examined the impact of online goal-setting training with and without personal values exploration (drawn from ACT) on undergraduate academic performance (GPA). Goal setting plus values training significantly improved GPAs over the semester and reduced student attrition the following semester. Goal setting alone had no effect compared to control conditions. Values component was the critical addition that activated intrinsic motivation.
- **Effect Size**: Significant GPA improvement and reduced attrition in values + goals condition vs. goals-only and control

**The Psychology of Change: Self-Affirmation and Social Psychological Intervention**
- **Authors**: Geoffrey L. Cohen, David K. Sherman
- **Year**: 2014
- **Title**: The Psychology of Change: Self-Affirmation and Social Psychological Intervention
- **Journal**: Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 65, Pages 333-371
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24405362/
- **Key Findings**: Comprehensive review establishing that self-affirmation interventions (writing about core personal values) bring about a more expansive view of the self, weaken threat implications for personal integrity, decrease stress, increase well-being, improve academic performance, and make people more open to behavior change. Brief self-affirmations can have effects that persist for days, weeks, months, and even years through positive feedback loops. Students receiving values affirmation earned higher grades and enrolled in more advanced courses over periods of 1 to 7 years.
- **Effect Size**: Long-term effects documented across 1-7 years; GPA improvements and course enrollment changes significant at P < 0.05 in multiple studies

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From Coaching Psychology and ACT Research:**
1. Values clarification should distinguish between values (ongoing directions) and goals (specific outcomes)
2. Values exploration must be client-directed, not prescribed by the practitioner
3. The process should connect present actions to deeper purpose and meaning
4. Values should be framed as freely chosen directions, not obligations or "shoulds"
5. Multiple life domains should be explored (career, relationships, health, personal growth, contribution)
6. Values-goal alignment increases intrinsic motivation and sustained effort
7. The technique should be delivered without judgment; all values are valid if freely chosen
8. Values clarification works best when followed by specific committed action planning

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Centering and Preparation (30-45 seconds)**
1. Guide the listener into a relaxed, reflective state
2. Take several calming breaths to shift from doing mode to being mode
3. Set intention: "We are going to explore what truly matters to you at your core"
4. Create psychological safety through non-judgmental framing

**Phase 2: Values Exploration (60-90 seconds)**
1. Invite reflection on life domains: career, relationships, health, personal growth, contribution
2. Ask guiding questions: "What kind of person do you want to be in this area?"
3. Explore what gives life meaning and purpose beyond external achievements
4. Help differentiate between authentic values and externally imposed expectations
5. Use open-ended prompts: "If no one was watching or judging, what would matter most to you?"

**Phase 3: Values-Performance Connection (60-90 seconds)**
1. Link identified values to current performance goals and challenges
2. Ask: "How does this goal connect to what you just identified as most important?"
3. Explore how achieving or pursuing the goal serves the deeper value
4. Reframe performance pressure as values-aligned action rather than obligation
5. Build the bridge: performance is not about proving worth but about living values

**Phase 4: Embodied Commitment (30-60 seconds)**
1. Invite the listener to feel the alignment between values and upcoming action
2. Notice physical sensations of purpose and motivation
3. Create a brief internal statement connecting the value to the action
4. Future pace: imagine acting from this values-aligned place in the next performance situation
5. Anchor the feeling of purposeful, values-driven motivation

### Contraindications
- **Values Conflict/Moral Injury**: Individuals experiencing severe values conflict or moral injury may need therapeutic processing before values clarification exercises
- **Severe Depression with Anhedonia**: Deeply depressed individuals may struggle to identify values and experience further distress when unable to connect with meaning
- **Active Grief**: Recent major loss may make values exploration feel overwhelming or pointless
- **Externally Imposed "Values"**: Clients in coercive environments may not be able to freely explore authentic values
- **Perfectionism**: Highly perfectionistic individuals may turn values into rigid rules, increasing rather than decreasing pressure

### Cautions
- Values should be framed as directions, not destinations or rules
- Avoid turning values clarification into a performance demand or "one more thing to optimize"
- Practitioners should not impose their own values or suggest what "should" matter
- Some clients may need multiple sessions to distinguish authentic values from internalized expectations
- Values clarification may surface existential questions that require more in-depth therapeutic work
- Cultural sensitivity is essential; values priorities differ across cultural contexts

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"Take a moment to let your attention settle inward. As you breathe slowly and deeply, I want you to consider something beyond the goals and targets you are working toward. Beneath every goal, there is a reason. A value. Something that makes the effort worthwhile. Think about your work, your career, your performance. What kind of person do you want to be in that arena? Not what you want to achieve, but who you want to be. Perhaps it is someone who gives their absolute best. Someone who leads with courage. Someone who creates something meaningful. Whatever it is, allow that value to come into focus now. And notice how, when you connect your next performance to this deeper purpose, the motivation shifts. It becomes less about pressure, and more about expression. Less about proving, and more about living what matters to you."

- **Source**: Adapted from ACT values clarification protocols and coaching psychology frameworks
- **Context**: Used during the values-performance connection phase of a pre-performance audio session
- **Duration**: Approximately 90 seconds at measured pace

### Specific Language Patterns

**Values Elicitation Patterns:**
- "What kind of person do you want to be when it matters most?"
- "If success were guaranteed, what would you do, and why would that matter to you?"
- "What gives this effort its meaning beyond the outcome?"
- "Think about a moment when you felt most alive and aligned. What value were you living?"

**Values-Action Connection Patterns:**
- "Notice how this goal connects to something deeper inside you..."
- "Your performance is not separate from your values; it is an expression of them..."
- "When you act from this place of purpose, effort becomes meaningful..."
- "This is not about what you have to do. This is about what you choose to do, because it matters..."

**Deepening and Anchoring Patterns:**
- "Feel what it is like to be driven not by pressure, but by purpose..."
- "Allow that sense of alignment to settle into your body..."
- "This is your compass. When things get difficult, this is what guides you back..."
- "Carry this knowing with you into every challenge, every opportunity..."

### Milton Model Elements
- **Presuppositions**: "As you discover what truly matters to you..." (presupposes they will discover it)
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can FEEL ALIGNED and MOVE WITH PURPOSE as you connect to your values"
- **Nominalizations**: "Purpose," "alignment," "meaning" — abstract enough for each listener to fill with their own content
- **Universal Quantifiers**: "Every performance is an opportunity to live your values..."
- **Mind Reading**: "And you already know, somewhere inside, what matters most..."
- **Pacing and Leading**: "You have goals you are working toward... and beneath those goals... there is something more fundamental..."
- **Temporal Predicates**: "In a moment, as this clarity settles in, you will notice a shift in how this goal feels..."
- **Tag Questions**: "That sense of purpose, you can feel it, can't you?"

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Warm, reflective, and unhurried. This is a contemplative technique, not an activating one. The voice should convey genuine curiosity and respect for the listener's inner world.
- **Pacing**: Slower than most performance techniques. Allow generous pauses (3-5 seconds) after key questions to permit genuine internal exploration. Do not rush the values discovery process.
- **Emphasis**: Gently emphasize words related to identity ("who you want to be"), purpose ("meaning," "matters"), and freedom ("choose," "freely").
- **Duration**: Full guided values clarification: 4-5 minutes. Brief pre-performance values connection: 2-3 minutes. Deep exploration with committed action: 8-10 minutes.
- **Volume**: Moderate to soft. Intimate, reflective atmosphere. Slightly lower volume than activation techniques.
- **Pauses**: Critical. Values clarification requires internal processing time. Longer pauses than most techniques.

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Sustaining motivation during difficult training periods, connecting daily effort to larger purpose, reducing performance anxiety by shifting focus from outcome to values, rebuilding motivation after setbacks or burnout
- **Target Audience**:
  - Athletes seeking deeper purpose beyond winning
  - Entrepreneurs aligning business decisions with personal values
  - Executives navigating high-pressure leadership with integrity
  - Sales professionals connecting their work to genuine service
  - Performers finding authentic expression in their craft
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Pre-season or pre-campaign motivation building
  - Recovering from a significant loss or failure
  - Transition periods (new role, new team, new challenge)
  - When external motivation (money, status, approval) begins to feel insufficient
  - Daily morning practice connecting the day's work to deeper purpose
  - Before difficult conversations or decisions requiring values-aligned courage

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Strong
- **Rationale**: Values clarification has robust research support across multiple domains:

**Strengths:**
1. Meta-analysis (Witteman et al., 2021) with 33 trials and 43 values clarification methods demonstrates significant effects on decision quality and reduced decisional conflict
2. Creswell et al. (2005) provides physiological evidence: values affirmation buffers neuroendocrine stress responses (cortisol reduction)
3. Cohen & Sherman (2014) comprehensive review documents effects persisting 1-7 years through positive feedback loops
4. Chase et al. (2013) demonstrates values training significantly improves academic performance and reduces attrition beyond goal-setting alone
5. Strong theoretical grounding in Self-Determination Theory (intrinsic motivation through autonomy and meaning)
6. ACT research consistently shows values-based interventions improve task persistence, well-being, and performance
7. Published in peer-reviewed journals (Psychological Science, Annual Review of Psychology, Medical Decision Making)

**Limitations:**
1. Most studies focus on decision-making or academic contexts rather than elite performance specifically
2. Effect sizes are small to moderate, though practically meaningful and durable
3. Individual differences in values awareness and introspective capacity affect outcomes
4. Distinguishing values clarification from self-affirmation and goal-setting effects can be methodologically challenging

**Conclusion**: Values clarification is a well-supported cognitive technique with strong evidence for enhancing motivation, reducing stress, improving decision quality, and sustaining performance through intrinsic purpose alignment. The evidence base spans neuroscience, social psychology, ACT, and coaching psychology.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Development
- Values clarification originated in the 1960s-1970s with Louis Raths, Merrill Harmin, and Sidney Simon's educational framework
- The original approach focused on helping students identify and act on their values through structured exercises
- Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values (1992) provided a cross-cultural framework for understanding value structures
- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Hayes, 1999) reinvigorated values work as a core therapeutic process
- Coaching psychology integrated values clarification as a foundational element of goal-setting and motivation
- Self-affirmation theory (Steele, 1988) provided the theoretical foundation for understanding why reflecting on personal values produces resilience

### Theoretical Foundations
**Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan):**
- Intrinsic motivation increases when actions align with autonomously chosen values
- Values clarification supports the need for autonomy (free choice) and relatedness (connection to what matters)
- Performance sustained by intrinsic motivation is more durable and satisfying than extrinsically driven effort

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Hayes):**
- Values are freely chosen, verbally constructed consequences of ongoing patterns of activity
- Values differ from goals: values are directions (being courageous), goals are destinations (getting a promotion)
- Values-congruent action increases psychological flexibility and well-being

**Self-Affirmation Theory (Steele):**
- When people affirm core values, they access a broader view of self that buffers against threat
- Values affirmation reduces defensive processing and opens people to growth-oriented information
- The protective effect operates through maintaining self-integrity rather than addressing specific threats

### Integration with Other Techniques
- **Mental Imagery**: Visualize values-aligned performance for compound motivational effect
- **Goal Setting**: Set goals that explicitly serve identified values for enhanced persistence
- **Cognitive Reframing**: Use values as the frame through which challenges are reinterpreted
- **Self-Talk**: Develop values-based self-talk cues ("I choose this because...")
- **Anchoring**: Anchor the feeling of values-alignment for on-demand access during performance
