## Academic Sources

### Primary Source: Classical Hypnosis Research
- **Author**: Clark L. Hull
- **Year**: 1933
- **Title**: Hypnosis and Suggestibility: An Experimental Approach
- **Publisher**: Appleton (New York); Modern edition: Crown House Publishing, 2002
- **URL**: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00029157.2004.10403608
- **Key Findings**: Hull's five-year research project effectively began the modern era of hypnosis research, leading to a "golden age" facilitated by development of behavioral scales for measuring hypnotizability. Hull concluded the essence of hypnosis lies in changes in suggestibility. Post-hypnotic suggestions demonstrated that hypnotized participants fell more quickly when suggestions were given in trance state vs. waking state. Established that suggestions can be programmed during hypnosis to activate after awakening.
- **Effect Size**: Significant behavioral differences between trance and waking suggestions documented

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From Hypnotherapy and Sports Hypnosis Research:**
1. Post-hypnotic suggestions must be installed during adequate trance depth (medium to deep)
2. Suggestions should be simple, clear, unambiguous, and devoid of complexity
3. Use present tense to create immediate activation ("you feel confident" not "you will feel")
4. Include specific trigger/context for activation ("when you arrive at the venue")
5. Suggestions must align with client's goals and be believable
6. Test during session by bringing client out of trance and observing activation
7. Reinforce through repetition and future pacing

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Trance Induction and Deepening (5-10 minutes)**
1. Use preferred induction technique (progressive relaxation, countdown, Dave Elman, etc.)
2. Deepen trance with fractionation or staircase deepener
3. Verify adequate trance depth through ideomotor testing or observation
4. Client should be in medium to deep trance state

**Phase 2: Future Pacing Preparation (2-3 minutes)**
1. "In a moment, I'll ask you to imagine yourself in the future situation..."
2. Have client visualize the specific context where suggestion will activate
3. Make it vivid and detailed (location, time, sensory details)
4. This creates mental anchor for post-hypnotic trigger

**Phase 3: Installing Post-Hypnotic Suggestion (3-5 minutes)**

**Formula: TRIGGER + RESPONSE**

**Trigger Specification:**
- Time-based: "Tomorrow morning when you wake up..."
- Location-based: "When you arrive at the office..."
- Object-based: "When you see your presentation clicker..."
- Action-based: "When you take your starting position..."
- Sensory-based: "When you hear the starting music..."

**Response Installation:**
- "...you feel completely confident and focused"
- "...your mind is clear and sharp"
- "...you experience calm determination"
- "...all your training comes together effortlessly"

**Complete Examples:**
1. "When you step onto the stage, you feel waves of confidence flowing through you, and you speak with clarity and presence."
2. "The moment you arrive at work tomorrow, you feel energized and motivated, ready to tackle your priorities with focus."
3. "When you grip the club, your body remembers perfect form, and you swing with smooth, confident precision."

**Phase 4: Reinforcement Through Repetition (2-3 minutes)**
1. Repeat the post-hypnotic suggestion 3-5 times with slight variations
2. Use different sensory modalities (visual, kinesthetic, auditory)
3. Build intensity and certainty with each repetition
4. "And this suggestion becomes stronger each time I mention it..."

**Phase 5: Future Rehearsal (2-3 minutes)**
1. Have client mentally rehearse the trigger-response sequence
2. "Now, imagine yourself in that moment... what happens?"
3. Client should visualize trigger occurring and response activating automatically
4. "See it, feel it, experience it as if it's happening now..."

**Phase 6: Seal and Lock (1 minute)**
1. "And your unconscious mind now fully accepts this suggestion..."
2. "It will activate automatically and naturally when the time comes..."
3. "You don't need to think about it consciously - it simply happens..."
4. Creates unconscious ownership and automatic activation

**Phase 7: Testing (2-3 minutes)**
1. Bring client out of trance using standard emergence procedure
2. Without overtly reminding them, create the trigger condition
3. Observe if post-hypnotic response activates
4. If successful: reinforce; if weak: re-induce and strengthen

**Phase 8: Conscious Reinforcement (Optional, 1-2 minutes)**
1. Can be made conscious or kept unconscious depending on goals
2. If conscious: briefly discuss what was installed and when it will activate
3. If unconscious: client may not consciously remember but will respond to trigger
4. Most performance applications use conscious awareness

### Contraindications
- **Severe Mental Illness**: Schizophrenia, active psychosis, dissociative identity disorder without appropriate clinical supervision
- **Suggestions Contrary to Values**: Never install suggestions against client's moral code or values
- **Safety-Critical Behaviors**: Do not install suggestions that could impair judgment in dangerous situations
- **Medical Conditions**: Post-hypnotic analgesia suggestions should not mask symptoms requiring medical attention
- **Legal/Coercive Contexts**: Cannot force actions against will; "hypnotic mind control" is myth
- **Poor Hypnotic Suggestibility**: Individuals with very low hypnotizability may not respond to post-hypnotic suggestions

### Cautions
- Effectiveness correlates strongly with hypnotic suggestibility (high suggestibles respond best)
- Suggestions must be realistic and believable to the individual
- Avoid creating suggestions with ambiguous language that could be misinterpreted
- Do not overload with too many post-hypnotic suggestions in one session (2-3 maximum)
- Some individuals may experience suggestions as intrusive if not properly framed
- Effects may diminish over time and require reinforcement
- Not effective for complex behavioral changes (use multiple sessions)

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt 1: Pre-Competition Confidence
"And now, as you rest deeply in this comfortable state, I want you to imagine tomorrow morning. You're preparing for your competition. And as you put on your uniform, a wave of confidence flows through you. This is your post-hypnotic signal - when you put on that uniform tomorrow, you immediately feel confident, focused, and ready. Your unconscious mind accepts this suggestion completely. Tomorrow, when you dress, confidence activates automatically."

- **Source**: Sports hypnosis protocols
- **Context**: Installing pre-competition confidence trigger
- **URL**: https://thepsychologytimes.com/2011/09/01/sports-hypnosis-in-practice-scripts-strategies-and-case-examples/

### Example Script Excerpt 2: Performance Trigger
"Now imagine yourself arriving at the venue. When you arrive at the building and see it, you feel a surge of motivation and energy. This post-hypnotic suggestion is now firmly implanted. The moment you see that building, motivation and energy flood through you naturally and effortlessly."

- **Source**: Clinical hypnosis protocols
- **Context**: Location-based performance activation
- **URL**: https://britishhypnosisresearch.com/post-hypnotic-suggestions-work-therapy/

### Example Script Excerpt 3: Future State Installation
"In your mind's eye, project yourself into that future situation. See yourself there, in that moment. And in that moment, you are calm, at ease, completely confident. This is not just imagination - this is programming. When you arrive in that real moment, you will feel exactly this way. Your unconscious mind will remember and activate these feelings automatically."

### Specific Language Patterns

**Trigger Introduction Patterns:**
- "When you [specific action], you will [desired response]..."
- "The moment you [trigger], immediately you [response]..."
- "As soon as you [trigger], you notice that you [response]..."
- "Every time you [trigger], automatically you [response]..."

**Present Tense Installation Patterns:**
- "You feel [desired state]..." (not "you will feel")
- "Confidence flows through you..." (present continuous)
- "You experience [desired state]..."
- "You are [desired state]..."

**Unconscious Acceptance Patterns:**
- "And your unconscious mind accepts this suggestion completely..."
- "This suggestion takes root deeply in your unconscious..."
- "Your inner mind now holds this suggestion ready to activate..."

**Automatic Activation Patterns:**
- "It happens automatically, naturally, effortlessly..."
- "You don't need to think about it - it simply occurs..."
- "Without conscious effort, this response activates..."

**Reinforcement Patterns:**
- "Each time this happens, the response grows stronger..."
- "The more this activates, the more natural it becomes..."
- "This suggestion becomes more powerful with each repetition..."

**Sealing Patterns:**
- "And now this suggestion is firmly sealed and locked in place..."
- "It remains active until [end condition, if applicable]..."
- "This post-hypnotic suggestion is now complete and ready..."

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You CAN FEEL CONFIDENT when you [trigger]"
- **Presuppositions**: "When you feel confident tomorrow..." (presupposes they will)
- **Temporal Predicates**: "Begin to," "Continue to," "As you..." (time-based linkage)
- **Cause-Effect**: "[Trigger] causes you to [response]" creates automatic linkage
- **Truisms**: "Everyone knows that preparation leads to confidence..." (pacing before suggestion)

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Authoritative yet permissive during installation; confident and certain
- **Pacing**: Slow and deliberate during suggestion installation; allow words to sink in
- **Emphasis**: Strong emphasis on trigger word/phrase and desired response
- **Duration**:
  - Full session with induction: 20-30 minutes
  - Suggestion installation phase: 5-8 minutes
  - Quick reinforcement (if already in trance): 2-3 minutes
- **Volume**: Moderate to slightly elevated during key suggestion phrases to convey certainty
- **Repetition**: Repeat core suggestion 3-5 times with variations for reinforcement
- **Pauses**: 2-3 second pauses after key suggestions to allow unconscious processing

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Pre-competition preparation, confidence installation, automatic performance triggers, stress management, behavioral programming, skill execution
- **Target Audience**:
  - Athletes preparing for competitions
  - Business professionals before presentations or high-stakes meetings
  - Performers (musicians, actors, speakers)
  - Individuals learning new skills or behaviors
  - Anyone seeking automatic positive responses to specific triggers
  - Entrepreneurs before pitches or important calls
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Install confidence trigger before athletic competition
  - Create calm response when entering high-pressure situations
  - Automatic focus activation when beginning important work
  - Morning energy and motivation trigger
  - Pre-presentation calm and clarity activation
  - Performance cue installation (e.g., grip golf club → perfect form)
  - Stress reduction response to specific situations
  - Sleep trigger (bedtime routine → immediate drowsiness)

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Moderate to Strong
- **Rationale**: Post-hypnotic suggestions have substantial research support with important qualifications:

**Strengths:**
1. Classical foundation from Hull (1933) establishing basic phenomenon
2. Recent high-quality studies (2024) showing significant effects on strength, memory, stress
3. Neuroscience evidence (fMRI) demonstrating actual brain changes (ACC activity reduction)
4. Effects persist over time (1 week to years documented)
5. Both subjective and objective performance measures show improvements
6. Replicated across diverse outcomes (physical, cognitive, emotional)
7. Published in peer-reviewed neuroscience and psychology journals

**Important Qualifications:**
1. **Hypnotic Suggestibility Critical**: Effects strongest in highly hypnotizable individuals; minimal or absent in low-hypnotizable persons
2. **Individual Differences**: Approximately 10-15% of population highly hypnotizable, 10-15% minimally hypnotizable, majority in middle
3. **Context Dependence**: Suggestions work best with clear, specific triggers in supportive contexts
4. **Complexity Limits**: Simple suggestions more effective than complex behavioral sequences
5. **Assessment Required**: Hypnotizability should be assessed (Stanford Scale, Harvard Group Scale) for realistic expectations

**Mechanisms:**
- Expectancy and belief play significant role
- Neural priming of response pathways
- Unconscious automatization of trigger-response sequences
- Possible role of dissociation allowing bypass of conscious inhibition

**Conclusion**: For highly hypnotizable individuals, post-hypnotic suggestions are evidence-based technique with documented effectiveness. Should be part of broader performance preparation. Less effective or ineffective for low-hypnotizable individuals. Best used with realistic expectations based on individual hypnotic capacity.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Context
- Post-hypnotic suggestions date to early hypnosis research (late 1800s)
- Hull (1933) brought experimental rigor to study
- Classical hypnosis stage shows featured post-hypnotic suggestions (sometimes unethically)
- Modern therapeutic applications focus on client-centered goals
- Integration with sports psychology and performance coaching (1970s-present)

### Hypnotic Suggestibility
**Assessment Tools:**
- Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale (SHSS)
- Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility
- Hypnotic Induction Profile (HIP)

**Population Distribution:**
- High hypnotizables: ~10-15%
- Medium hypnotizables: ~70-80%
- Low hypnotizables: ~10-15%

**Factors Affecting Suggestibility:**
- Absorption capacity (ability to become immersed in experiences)
- Imaginative involvement
- Dissociation capacity
- Expectancy and belief in hypnosis
- Rapport with hypnotist
- Motivation and goal alignment

### Types of Post-Hypnotic Suggestions

**By Awareness:**
- **Conscious**: Client remembers suggestion and expects it to activate
- **Unconscious**: Client may not consciously recall but suggestion activates anyway
- **Hybrid**: Partial awareness of general suggestion but not all details

**By Complexity:**
- **Simple**: Single trigger → single response ("See clicker → feel calm")
- **Complex**: Multiple triggers or multi-step behavioral sequences (generally less effective)
- **Conditional**: If-then structures with contingencies

**By Duration:**
- **Time-Limited**: "This works for the next 30 days, then naturally fades"
- **Ongoing**: Remains active indefinitely until consciously changed
- **Single-Use**: "This activates once, then is complete"

**By Content:**
- **Emotional**: State changes (confidence, calm, motivation)
- **Cognitive**: Thought patterns (focus, clarity, creative thinking)
- **Behavioral**: Actions (performance execution, habit activation)
- **Physiological**: Body responses (relaxation, alertness, pain modulation)
- **Sensory**: Perceptual changes (enhanced focus, sensory sharpness)

### Integration with Other Techniques
- **Anchoring (NLP)**: Post-hypnotic suggestion is form of anchoring with hypnotic installation
- **Mental Imagery**: Combine visualization with post-hypnotic programming
- **Pre-Performance Routines**: Use post-hypnotic suggestions to strengthen routine effectiveness
- **Self-Hypnosis**: Teach clients to install own post-hypnotic suggestions
- **Goal Setting**: Link post-hypnotic responses to specific goal achievement moments

### Rules for Effective Suggestions

**Hull and Modern Research Guidelines:**
1. **Simple and Clear**: Avoid ambiguity or complex language
2. **Positive Framing**: State what to do, not what to avoid ("feel calm" not "don't feel anxious")
3. **Believable**: Within client's realm of possibility
4. **Specific Trigger**: Clear, identifiable activation condition
5. **Present Tense**: Creates immediacy and reality ("you feel" not "you will feel")
6. **Aligned with Goals**: Must match client's explicit desires
7. **Ego-Syntonic**: Compatible with client's values and identity
8. **Repeatable**: Can be activated multiple times if needed

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Installing suggestions too complex or multi-step
2. Using future tense instead of present tense
3. Creating vague or ambiguous triggers
4. Overloading with too many suggestions in one session
5. Not testing the suggestion before ending session
6. Attempting with clients who have low hypnotizability without assessment
7. Using negative framing ("don't be nervous" instead of "feel calm")
8. Installing suggestions contrary to client's values

### Practical Tips for Practitioners
**Assessment Phase:**
- Test hypnotizability before promising results
- Discuss realistic expectations based on individual capacity
- Identify most relevant triggers from client's actual life

**Installation Phase:**
- Ensure adequate trance depth before installing
- Use vivid sensory detail in future pacing
- Repeat suggestion multiple times with variations
- Anchor suggestion with kinesthetic element when possible

**Testing Phase:**
- Always test before ending session if possible
- Observe client's response objectively
- If weak, re-induce and strengthen installation

**Follow-Up:**
- Check effectiveness at next session
- Reinforce successful suggestions
- Adjust or replace ineffective ones
- Teach self-hypnosis for ongoing reinforcement

### Athletic Performance Applications
**Common Performance Suggestions:**
- "When you step onto the field, confidence flows through you"
- "As you enter the starting blocks, your body remembers perfect form"
- "When you grip your racket, focus sharpens instantly"
- "The moment you hear the starting signal, explosive power activates"
- "When you address the ball, calm certainty fills your mind"

**Research Support:**
- Modified Autogenic Training with post-hypnotic suggestions showed improvements (Improving Competitive Performance study)
- Athletic training programs incorporate posthypnotic suggestions successfully
- Alert/open-eye hypnosis with post-hypnotic suggestions described as essential for athletes
