- **Journal**: International Review of Sport and Exercise Psychology
- **URL**: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1750984X.2021.1944271
- **Key Findings**: Meta-analysis of 112 effect sizes from 15 different sports and approximately 800 athletes. Athletes using PPRs significantly outperformed counterparts without routines. Effects observed for both novices and elite athletes, in laboratory and competition settings, under low-pressure and high-pressure conditions. Performance benefits were independent of age, gender, skill level, routine type, and learning duration. Even brief PPR learning (as little as 10 minutes) produced measurable effects.
- **Effect Size**: Pre-post designs: SMC = 0.31 (95% CI [0.18, 0.44]). Experimental designs under low pressure: Hedges' g = 0.64 (95% CI [0.45, 0.83]). Experimental designs under pressure: Hedges' g = 0.70.

- **Key Findings**: Tested 60 experienced Australian football players performing 20 kicks under low- and high-pressure conditions. Four intervention groups received PPR training while one control group did not. Combining different PPR elements (cognitive, behavioral, breathing, cue words) was more effective than using individual elements in isolation. PPRs successfully attenuated choking under pressure.
- **Effect Size**: Significant group x pressure interaction; combined PPR elements outperformed single-element routines

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From Sport Psychology Research:**
1. PPRs should include both behavioral (motor) and cognitive (mental) components for maximum effectiveness
2. The routine must be consistent in sequence and duration across repetitions
3. Routines are most effective for self-paced, closed-skill tasks (serves, free throws, putts, penalty kicks)
4. Athletes should develop their routine collaboratively with a sport psychologist, incorporating personally meaningful elements
5. The routine should be practiced extensively in low-pressure training before use in competition
6. Routine duration should typically range from 5 to 30 seconds for most sport skills
7. Each element in the routine should serve a specific functional purpose (attentional focus, arousal regulation, motor priming)
8. The routine should be flexible enough to adapt to different competitive contexts while maintaining core structure

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Assessment and Design (Initial Session)**
1. Identify the specific self-paced skill the routine will support
2. Analyze the athlete's current pre-performance behavior (if any)
3. Determine optimal arousal level for the task
4. Select 3-5 routine elements from evidence-based categories:
   - Physical preparation actions (e.g., bouncing ball, stance alignment)
   - Breathing regulation (e.g., one controlled exhale)
   - Attentional cue (e.g., focus on target, cue word)
   - Visualization element (e.g., brief image of successful execution)
   - Trigger action (e.g., final physical movement that initiates performance)
5. Sequence the elements in a logical order from general to specific

**Phase 2: Routine Installation (1-2 minutes per execution)**
1. Athlete takes their position for the skill
2. Initiate the routine with a consistent starting action (deep breath, stance set)
3. Execute each behavioral element in sequence
4. Insert the cognitive element (cue word, brief visualization) at the designated point
5. Complete with the trigger action that transitions directly into skill execution
6. Maintain consistent timing across all repetitions

**Phase 3: Practice and Refinement (Ongoing)**
1. Practice the routine 50-100 times in low-pressure training environments
2. Gradually introduce mild pressure conditions (simulated competition, audience)
3. Time the routine to ensure consistency (within 1-2 seconds each time)
4. Refine elements that feel unnatural or disruptive
5. Video review to verify behavioral consistency
6. Progress to full competition use only when the routine feels automatic

### Contraindications
- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder**: Rigid routines may reinforce compulsive tendencies; adapt with flexibility built into the routine structure
- **Severe Performance Anxiety**: If anxiety is clinical-level, PPRs should complement professional treatment rather than serve as the sole intervention
- **Externally-Paced Tasks**: PPRs are designed for self-paced skills; forcing a routine onto reactive or externally-timed tasks may impair performance
- **Time-Constrained Situations**: When competition rules or game pace do not allow sufficient time for routine execution

### Cautions
- Over-rigid adherence to routine when disrupted can increase anxiety rather than reduce it
- Athletes must learn to adapt when routines are interrupted (e.g., by opponents, officials, weather)
- Routines that are too long (>30 seconds for most skills) may disrupt flow and invite overthinking
- The routine should not become superstitious behavior; every element must serve a functional purpose
- Avoid changing routines immediately before important competitions
- Athletes with low self-awareness may need additional interoceptive training before routine development

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"Now that you're in position, let's walk through your routine. Take one deep breath -- in through the nose, out through the mouth -- and feel your feet settle into the ground. As you bounce the ball twice, let that rhythm ground your focus. Now, as you look at the target, say your cue word silently -- 'center' -- and see the ball going exactly where you want it to go. Hold that image for just a beat. And then... release. Trust the preparation. Your body knows what to do."

- **Source**: Adapted from sport psychology PPR installation protocols (Cotterill, 2010; Lidor & Singer, 2003)
- **Context**: Pre-performance routine walkthrough during training, basketball free throw application
- **Duration**: 2-3 minutes for guided walkthrough; 5-15 seconds for autonomous execution

### Specific Language Patterns

1. "Every time you step up, this routine brings you into your best state..." (consistency anchoring)
2. "This sequence is your signal to your body that it's time to perform..." (routine as trigger)
3. "The routine takes care of your mind so your body can take care of the skill..." (conscious/unconscious division)
4. "Each element has a purpose -- nothing wasted, everything serving your performance..." (purposeful design)
5. "When you complete this sequence, you've done everything you need to do -- now trust it..." (release of conscious control)
6. "Your routine is your home base -- no matter what's happening around you, this is your space..." (routine as safe structure)
7. "Feel the familiarity of each step -- this is where confidence lives..." (familiarity breeds confidence)
8. "The same routine, the same focus, the same result -- consistency creates excellence..." (consistency principle)
9. "As the routine becomes automatic, your mind is free to be fully present..." (automaticity benefit)
10. "This is your pre-performance handshake with success..." (metaphor for commitment)

### Milton Model Elements
- **Presupposition**: "As you settle into your routine..." -- presupposes routine execution will happen naturally
- **Nominalization**: "Find your focus" -- transforms a dynamic attentional process into a simple noun
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can TRUST your preparation and LET GO into the performance"
- **Pacing and Leading**: "You're standing here now, ball in hand, and as you begin your routine, your body remembers exactly what to do..."
- **Truisms**: "Athletes who prepare consistently perform consistently..." -- builds agreement
- **Metaphor**: "Your routine is like tuning an instrument before a concert -- the performance is only as good as the preparation..."
- **Dissociation**: "Watch yourself from above, moving through the routine smoothly and effortlessly..."

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Calm, confident, and rhythmic during routine installation. Match the pacing of the routine itself -- steady and measured, with slight emphasis on the cue word or visualization moment.
- **Pacing**: During initial teaching, slow and deliberate with pauses between each element. As the athlete practices, reduce verbal guidance and allow increasing autonomy. Eventually, the practitioner is silent during routine execution.
- **Emphasis**: Stress the transition point between routine completion and skill execution. This is the critical "release" moment where conscious preparation yields to automatic performance.
- **Duration**: Full guided walkthrough: 2-3 minutes. Abbreviated verbal cues during practice: 15-30 seconds. Autonomous execution by athlete: 5-15 seconds (sport-dependent).
- **Volume**: Moderate and steady. Avoid sudden volume changes that could disrupt the athlete's attentional focus during routine practice.
- **Pauses**: Use strategic pauses at each transition point within the routine to help the athlete internalize the rhythm and timing of their sequence.

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Self-paced sport skills (free throws, serves, putts, penalty kicks, gymnastics routines), pre-competition mental preparation, choking prevention under pressure, attention management during competition, building competitive consistency
- **Target Audience**:
  - Competitive athletes in self-paced sports (golf, tennis, basketball, cricket, archery, shooting)
  - Performing artists preparing for stage performances
  - Surgeons and medical professionals before procedures
  - Executives and speakers before presentations
  - Military and law enforcement personnel before operations
  - E-sports competitors before matches
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Basketball free throw preparation
  - Tennis serve routine
  - Golf pre-shot routine
  - Penalty kick preparation in soccer
  - Gymnast preparing for a routine on apparatus
  - Archer or shooter preparing for each shot
  - Diver standing on the platform before a dive
  - Weightlifter approaching the bar

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Strong
- **Rationale**: Pre-performance routines are one of the most extensively researched and widely applied interventions in sport psychology, supported by a comprehensive meta-analysis and decades of applied research.

**Strengths:**
1. Meta-analysis of 112 effect sizes demonstrates robust performance benefits (g = 0.64-0.70 in experimental designs)
2. Effects are consistent across skill levels, ages, genders, and sport types
3. Benefits observed in both laboratory and real competition settings
4. Effective under both low-pressure and pressurized conditions
5. Theoretically grounded in attentional control theory, automaticity theory, and self-regulation frameworks
6. One of the most commonly delivered interventions by professional sport psychologists worldwide
7. Minimal learning time required (effects found with as little as 10 minutes of instruction)
8. Low risk of adverse effects when properly implemented

**Limitations:**
1. Most effective for self-paced, closed skills; limited applicability to reactive or open skills
2. Over-rigid routines may increase anxiety when disrupted
3. Heterogeneity in routine content makes it difficult to determine which specific elements are most effective
4. Most research conducted in laboratory settings; more field-based studies needed
5. Long-term maintenance of routine use and effects requires ongoing practice

**Conclusion**: Pre-performance routines have a strong evidence base with large meta-analytic effect sizes, broad applicability across sports and skill levels, and established theoretical mechanisms. They represent one of the best-supported practical interventions in sport psychology.

## Additional Notes

### Theoretical Mechanisms
Six mechanisms have been proposed for why PPRs enhance performance (Cotterill, 2010):
1. **Triggering automatic execution**: The routine activates well-learned motor programs
2. **Environmental calibration**: Allows the performer to assess conditions and adjust responses
3. **Attentional redirection**: Diverts attention from task-irrelevant or anxiety-provoking thoughts
4. **State recall**: Increases recall of optimal physiological and psychological performance states
5. **Anti-paralysis by analysis**: Prevents over-concentration on skill mechanics
6. **Concentration enhancement**: Increases focus while reducing susceptibility to distraction

### Components of Effective PPRs
Research identifies several common components in effective pre-performance routines:
- **Behavioral/Motor**: Physical actions related to the skill (ball bouncing, practice swings, stance setting)
- **Breathing**: Controlled exhalation or specific breathing pattern to regulate arousal
- **Attentional cues**: Focus on a specific target or cue point
- **Verbal cues**: Self-talk or trigger words that direct focus
- **Imagery**: Brief mental image of successful execution
- **Temporal consistency**: Maintaining consistent duration across repetitions

### Sport-Specific Examples
- **Golf**: Waggle, practice swing, alignment check, deep breath, target focus, swing trigger
- **Basketball free throws**: Bounce ball (set number), deep breath, target fixation, cue word, shoot
- **Tennis serve**: Ball bounce, breath, ball toss visualization, target focus, toss and serve
- **Archery**: Stance set, nock arrow, breath cycle, draw, anchor point, aim, release cue
- **Penalty kicks**: Place ball, step back, deep breath, target selection, approach trigger

### Integration with Other Techniques
- **Arousal Regulation**: PPRs often include a breathing or centering component for arousal calibration
- **Mental Imagery**: Brief visualization of successful execution is a common PPR element
- **Positive Self-Talk**: Cue words or trigger phrases serve as verbal anchors within the routine
- **Centering Technique**: Nideffer's centering is frequently integrated as a PPR component
- **Anchoring (NLP)**: Physical trigger actions within the routine can function as kinesthetic anchors
