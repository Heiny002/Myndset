- **Title**: Effect of Breathwork on Stress and Mental Health: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised-Controlled Trials
- **Journal**: Scientific Reports, 13, 432
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36624160/
- **Key Findings**: First comprehensive meta-analysis of breathwork RCTs. Twelve randomised-controlled trials (785 adult participants) showed breathwork was associated with significantly lower stress than control conditions. Secondary analyses for anxiety (k = 20) and depressive symptoms (k = 18) also yielded significant effect sizes. Breathwork techniques involving slow, controlled exhalation patterns were particularly effective.
- **Effect Size**: Stress: g = -0.35 [95% CI -0.55, -0.14]; Anxiety: g = -0.32; Depression: g = -0.40

- **Journal**: Cell Reports Medicine, 4(1), 100895
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9873947/
- **Key Findings**: Remote randomised controlled study comparing three daily 5-minute breathwork exercises (cyclic sighing, box breathing, cyclic hyperventilation with retention) with mindfulness meditation over one month. Exhale-focused breathing (cyclic sighing) produced greater improvement in mood and greater reduction in respiratory rate compared to mindfulness meditation. All breathwork conditions improved mood and reduced anxiety, with breathing exercises showing advantages over passive meditation.
- **Effect Size**: Breathwork groups showed significantly greater mood improvement than meditation (p < 0.05); cyclic sighing most effective for respiratory rate reduction (p < 0.05)

- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34306146/
- **Key Findings**: Sixty healthy participants randomized to progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, guided imagery, or control. All three active conditions significantly increased relaxation compared to control. Deep breathing showed immediate physiological arousal increase followed by rapid return and subsequent relaxation. Guided imagery and PMR showed immediate linear trends toward physiological relaxation. Audio-delivered instruction was effective.
- **Effect Size**: All active conditions significantly higher on relaxation after training compared to control (p < 0.05)

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From Breathwork Research and Self-Hypnosis Practice:**
1. Countdown breathing is a self-hypnosis induction and deepening technique that pairs reverse counting with the exhale phase of the breath cycle
2. The practitioner (or self-practitioner) counts backwards from 100 (or a chosen starting number), assigning one count to each exhale
3. The technique works through dual-task absorption: the counting occupies the analytical mind while the breath focus activates the parasympathetic nervous system
4. As numbers decrease, the metaphorical association of "going down" with "going deeper" reinforces trance deepening
5. The technique is particularly suited for self-hypnosis because it requires no external guide once the pattern is established
6. Breath rate naturally slows during the exercise, producing measurable reductions in respiratory rate and physiological arousal
7. Can be used as a standalone self-hypnosis practice or as an induction/deepener within a guided session

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Preparation and Positioning (30-60 seconds)**
1. Find a comfortable seated or reclined position
2. Close the eyes gently
3. Take 3-4 natural breaths to establish a baseline rhythm
4. Set the intention: "I am going to count down from 100 with each exhale, allowing myself to go deeper into relaxation with every number"
5. Allow the body to settle; no forcing or efforting

**Phase 2: Initial Countdown (100-80)**
1. On the first exhale, silently say "100"
2. Inhale naturally, without counting
3. On the next exhale, say "99"
4. Continue this pattern: exhale = count, inhale = rest
5. During this phase, the practitioner establishes the rhythm and begins to notice the breath slowing
6. Each number is a suggestion to go slightly deeper
7. If the mind wanders, gently return to the last remembered number

**Phase 3: Deepening Phase (80-50)**
1. By this point, breathing has typically slowed to 4-6 breaths per minute
2. The counting becomes more automatic and less effortful
3. Add the suggestion "deeper" or "more relaxed" between counts as desired
4. Physical sensations of heaviness or warmth may begin to appear
5. The analytical mind becomes progressively quieter as the counting task occupies it
6. Some practitioners may begin to lose track of exact numbers -- this is a sign of trance onset

**Phase 4: Deep Trance Onset (50 and below)**
1. Many practitioners reach significant trance depth between 70 and 50
2. Numbers may begin to blur, skip, or disappear entirely
3. If numbers disappear, this indicates somnambulistic depth (similar to Elman number disappearance)
4. The practitioner may continue counting or simply rest in the trance state
5. At this depth, the mind is highly receptive to suggestion, visualization, or therapeutic work
6. Not all practitioners will reach below 50 in a single session; depth improves with practice

**Phase 5: Utilization or Rest (Variable duration)**
1. Once desired depth is achieved, the practitioner can:
   - Continue counting to deepen further
   - Pause and deliver self-suggestions or affirmations
   - Engage in visualization or mental rehearsal
   - Simply rest in the trance state for restorative purposes
2. The trance state can be maintained for as long as desired

**Phase 6: Emergence (60-90 seconds)**
1. When ready to emerge, count up from 1 to 5
2. With each ascending number, suggest increasing alertness and wakefulness
3. At 5, open the eyes feeling refreshed, alert, and clear
4. Take a moment to orient to the environment
5. Optionally, stretch and take a few energizing breaths

### Contraindications
- **Hyperventilation Tendency**: Individuals with a history of hyperventilation or panic disorder should be monitored; the technique should slow breathing, not speed it
- **Severe Respiratory Conditions**: COPD, severe asthma, or other conditions where breath awareness may trigger anxiety about breathing
- **Active Psychosis**: As with all hypnotic techniques, not appropriate during active psychotic episodes
- **Dissociative Disorders**: Use with caution in individuals with severe dissociative conditions
- **Driving or Operating Machinery**: Never practice countdown breathing while driving or operating equipment

### Cautions
- Some individuals may experience mild dizziness if breathing becomes too slow or too deep initially; instruct them to breathe naturally
- Highly analytical individuals may find the simplicity of the exercise frustrating; encourage passive acceptance rather than efforting
- The technique may not produce deep trance on first attempt; regular practice (daily for 1-2 weeks) builds depth
- If anxiety increases during the exercise, instruct the practitioner to open eyes and return to normal breathing
- Audio delivery requires clear pacing cues; too-fast counting instructions can prevent natural breath slowing
- Not all individuals will experience number disappearance; this is not a failure indicator

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"Close your eyes now and take a few easy breaths. Just letting your body settle. In a moment, you're going to begin counting backwards from one hundred. Each time you breathe out, you'll silently say the next number. And with each number, you'll notice yourself drifting a little deeper. A little more relaxed. A little more at ease. So on your next exhale... one hundred... breathing in... and out... ninety-nine... each number carrying you deeper... ninety-eight... there's nowhere to go, nothing to do... ninety-seven... just the breath and the numbers... ninety-six... and with each count, that relaxation doubles... ninety-five..."

- **Source**: Adapted from self-hypnosis breath-counting protocols and clinical hypnotherapy practice
- **Context**: Opening guided version of countdown breathing, establishing the rhythm and deepening suggestion
- **Duration**: This excerpt covers approximately the first 90 seconds of the 5-minute technique

### Specific Language Patterns

1. **Rhythm establishment**: "On each exhale, silently say the next number... inhale... and exhale... the number..."
2. **Deepening suggestion**: "With each number, you drift a little deeper into comfortable relaxation."
3. **Metaphorical descent**: "Each number takes you one step deeper... counting down into calm."
4. **Permission to let go**: "If the numbers begin to fade or blur, that's perfectly fine... it means you're going deeper."
5. **Breath pacing**: "Let the breath find its own natural rhythm... slow... easy... effortless."
6. **Dual-task absorption**: "The numbers occupy your conscious mind while your body does what it knows how to do... relax."
7. **Progressive relaxation link**: "And with every exhale, tension leaves the body... with every number, the mind grows quieter."
8. **Anticipatory suggestion**: "By the time you reach fifty, or perhaps sooner, you may notice the numbers becoming less important... the relaxation becoming everything."
9. **Self-reinforcement**: "Each time you practice this, you go deeper faster... your mind remembers the way down."
10. **Emergence preview**: "And when you're ready to return, you'll count up from one to five, feeling refreshed and alert."

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can COUNT DOWN now and RELAX DEEPLY as you BREATHE OUT each number."
- **Presuppositions**: "When you notice how deep you've gone..." (presupposes depth)
- **Temporal Predicates**: "By the time you reach fifty..." (presupposes continued deepening)
- **Pacing and Leading**: "You're sitting here, breathing naturally, and with each breath that relaxation is beginning to deepen..."
- **Truisms**: "Everyone knows how to count backwards. Your mind can do this effortlessly."
- **Cause-Effect Linkage**: "The lower the number, the deeper you go."
- **Analogical Marking**: Slower pace and lower tone on words like "deeper," "relax," "calm," "down"

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Soft, steady, and progressively slower as the countdown proceeds. The voice should model the relaxation it suggests.
- **Pacing**: Begin at normal conversational pace for setup; slow to approximately one count per 8-12 seconds by the deepening phase. Allow silence between counts for the inhale.
- **Emphasis**: Gentle emphasis on the number and on deepening words ("deeper," "relaxed," "calm"). No sharp emphasis -- everything smooth and flowing.
- **Volume**: Moderate at start, progressively softer through the countdown. The decreasing volume mirrors the decreasing numbers.
- **Rhythm**: The counting creates a natural metronome effect. Maintain steady, predictable intervals. The rhythm itself becomes hypnotic through repetition.
- **Breathing**: The practitioner's voice should coordinate with the listener's breath cycle when delivering guided version. Speak numbers on the listener's exhale; pause during inhale.
- **Silence**: Increasingly important as the technique progresses. By the deep phase, silence between numbers should be 6-10 seconds.

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Self-hypnosis practice, pre-sleep relaxation, pre-performance calming, daily stress management, building trance skills for beginners, recovery between high-intensity events
- **Target Audience**: Athletes learning self-hypnosis for the first time, executives seeking a portable stress management tool, performers managing pre-show nerves, individuals with insomnia, anyone wanting a structured meditation alternative, beginners to hypnosis and trance work
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Daily self-hypnosis practice for athletes (5 minutes before training or competition)
  - Pre-sleep wind-down routine to reduce racing thoughts
  - Mid-day stress reset for professionals (5-minute office practice)
  - Pre-presentation calming technique
  - Building foundational trance skills before advancing to more complex hypnotic techniques
  - Recovery and restoration between competition heats or performance sets
  - Portable technique requiring no equipment, guide, or special environment

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Moderate
- **Rationale**: Countdown breathing draws its evidence base from two well-supported domains: breathwork/controlled breathing and self-hypnosis induction. The Fincham et al. (2023) meta-analysis of 12 RCTs provides strong evidence that breathwork significantly reduces stress (g = -0.35), anxiety (g = -0.32), and depression (g = -0.40). Balban et al. (2023) demonstrated that exhale-focused breathing practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal in a rigorous RCT published in Cell Reports Medicine. Toussaint et al. (2021) confirmed that deep breathing and guided imagery produce significant relaxation responses when delivered via audio. The Milling et al. (2023) umbrella review confirms hypnosis efficacy across multiple domains with medium to large effects. Olendzki et al. (2020) demonstrated that breath-focused self-hypnosis is feasible and effective as a daily practice. However, no RCT has specifically isolated the "counting down from 100 while breathing" protocol as an independent variable. The technique is a synthesis of well-supported components (controlled breathing + counting + self-hypnosis induction) rather than a directly validated standalone intervention. Evidence is rated moderate because the constituent elements are well-supported even though the specific composite technique lacks dedicated clinical trials.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Development
- Countdown inductions are among the oldest and most widely used techniques in hypnosis, with roots in 19th-century hypnotherapy
- The specific combination of counting with breathing appears in Paul McKenna's popular self-hypnosis protocols (counting from 300), Betty Erickson's self-hypnosis method, and numerous clinical hypnotherapy training curricula
- The technique represents a bridge between breathwork/meditation and formal hypnosis, making it accessible to individuals who may be skeptical of or unfamiliar with hypnosis
- Modern research on breathwork (2020-2023) has provided scientific validation for the physiological mechanisms underlying the technique

### Relationship to Other Techniques
- **Dave Elman Induction**: Elman's number disappearance phase (counting from 100) is conceptually similar but uses mental relaxation doubling rather than breath pairing
- **Autogenic Training**: Both are self-directed relaxation techniques; countdown breathing is simpler and faster to learn
- **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Can be combined by adding muscle release suggestions to specific number ranges
- **Post-Hypnotic Suggestion**: The trance state achieved via countdown breathing can serve as the platform for post-hypnotic suggestion installation
- **Safe Place Visualization**: Countdown breathing can be used as the induction phase before transitioning to safe place imagery

### Key Distinguishing Features
- **Self-Directed**: Designed primarily for self-hypnosis; does not require a practitioner once learned
- **Portable**: No equipment, special environment, or external guide required
- **Scalable Depth**: Starting number can be adjusted (50, 100, 200, 300) based on desired depth and available time
- **Dual-Task Design**: Counting occupies the analytical mind while breath focus activates relaxation -- elegant simplicity
- **Measurable Progress**: The practitioner can track at which number trance onset occurred, providing a measure of improving skill over time
- **Breath Regulation**: Unlike pure counting inductions, the breath pairing actively slows respiration, adding a physiological mechanism to the cognitive one
