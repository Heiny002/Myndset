- **Journal**: International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, 60(3), 338-355
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22681329/
- **Key Findings**: Twelve healthy volunteers underwent hypnotic deepening with relaxation or fractionation (without relaxation) in a randomized Latin-square protocol. EEG alpha activity, brain electromagnetic tomography, and hemodynamics were monitored. After relaxation, forearm flow decreased by 18% and blood pressure decreased by 4%. After fractionation, forearm flow decrease was comparable but blood pressure remained unchanged, leading to a 51% increase in forearm resistance. Alpha activity increased in the precuneus after fractionation only, suggesting distinct neural mechanisms. Both techniques produced vasoconstriction, confirming physiological trance deepening, but through different neural pathways.
- **Effect Size**: Forearm flow reduction: -18% (relaxation) vs comparable decrease (fractionation); Forearm resistance increase: +51% (fractionation only); Blood pressure reduction: -4% (relaxation only)

### Supporting Studies

**Fractionation in Self-Hypnosis**
- **Authors**: Frischholz, E. J., & Spiegel, D.
- **Year**: 1988
- **Title**: The Use of Fractionation in Self-Hypnosis
- **Journal**: American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, 30(2), 124-131
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3687812/
- **Key Findings**: Forty-two volunteers and 11 clinical patients participated in an experiment comparing two deepening conditions -- silence and fractionated awakening -- on self-hypnosis tapes that were otherwise identical. Almost no differences were found between conditions on experiential qualities of trance, depth of trance, or response to behavioral suggestions. Fractionation was preferred and beneficial for some individuals and not helpful for others. Results cast some doubt on the widespread belief in the unusual effectiveness of fractionation, though the study used only one fractionated awakening, which may not have adequately evaluated the technique (multiple cycles are standard in clinical practice).
- **Effect Size**: No significant differences between conditions on trance depth or suggestion responsiveness; individual variation noted

- **Journal**: The Journal of Pain, 23(6), 1065-1076
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35108620/
- **Key Findings**: Monocentric RCT with 33 patients using the Dave Elman technique (which includes fractionation as Phase 2) for dental procedures. The Elman induction protocol explicitly incorporated fractionation through repeated eye opening and closing cycles. Patients with high expectations about hypnosis showed significantly greater benefit, with expectancy identified as a key moderator of outcomes.
- **Effect Size**: Significant interaction effect for patient expectancy; no significant overall effect vs standard anesthetics

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From Casiglia et al. (2012), Elman (1964), and Vogt/Brodmann Historical Method:**
1. Fractionation is a hypnotic deepening technique based on the principle that repeatedly bringing a subject in and out of trance deepens the trance state with each successive cycle
2. The technique was first described by Oskar Vogt in 1895 and refined by Krafft-Ebing, later popularized by Dave Elman who called it "Three Visits to Bernheim"
3. Elman's insight came from observing that Bernheim's patients went into deeper hypnotic states with each successive visit, and he compressed this into a single session through rapid cycling
4. The mechanism operates through a rebound effect: each micro-arousal (emergence) is followed by deeper relaxation upon re-induction, compounding depth exponentially
5. Fractionation produces distinct neurophysiological changes from relaxation-based deepening, including increased precuneus alpha activity (Casiglia et al., 2012)
6. Standard clinical practice uses 3-5 fractionation cycles; a single cycle may be insufficient (Frischholz & Spiegel, 1988)
7. The technique can be delivered as a standalone deepener or integrated into broader induction protocols (e.g., the Elman Induction)

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Initial Induction (60-90 seconds)**
1. Induce trance using any preferred induction method (eye fixation, progressive relaxation, countdown, etc.)
2. Establish baseline trance depth through standard suggestions of relaxation and comfort
3. Confirm initial trance indicators: slowed breathing, muscular relaxation, eye flutter cessation
4. This baseline need not be deep -- fractionation will handle the deepening

**Phase 2: First Emergence (15-20 seconds)**
1. Say: "In a moment, I'm going to ask you to open your eyes. When you do, you'll maintain much of this relaxation."
2. Instruct: "Now, open your eyes."
3. Allow 5-10 seconds of eyes-open state
4. Observe: Subject should appear slightly disoriented, relaxed, not fully alert
5. The brief emergence creates a contrast state -- a micro-arousal that sets up the rebound

**Phase 3: Re-Induction with Deepening (20-30 seconds)**
1. Say: "Now close your eyes and go deeper than before. Twice as deep. Instantly."
2. The subject's eyes close and trance depth increases dramatically
3. Allow 10-15 seconds of silence for the deepening to consolidate
4. Confirm increased depth through observation (greater muscular relaxation, slower breathing, reduced movement)

**Phase 4: Subsequent Cycles (Repeat 2-4 more times)**
1. Repeat the emergence-reinduction cycle 2-4 additional times
2. Each cycle uses stronger deepening language: "Twice as deep... four times as deep... eight times as deep..."
3. Each emergence becomes briefer (3-5 seconds) and each re-induction becomes faster
4. The compounding effect means each cycle produces geometrically greater depth
5. By the 3rd or 4th cycle, most subjects demonstrate clear somnambulistic indicators

**Phase 5: Depth Confirmation and Utilization (Variable)**
1. After the final re-induction, confirm depth through appropriate tests (arm catalepsy, ideomotor signaling, or verbal report)
2. Say: "Now you are deeply relaxed, deeply comfortable, at a level where powerful changes can happen easily."
3. Transition to the therapeutic or performance intervention
4. The subject is now in a highly suggestible state suitable for direct suggestion, visualization, or other hypnotic work

**Phase 6: Emergence (60-90 seconds)**
1. When the session work is complete, emerge the subject with a count-up from 1 to 5
2. Include suggestions of alertness, refreshment, and well-being at each count
3. At 5, eyes open, fully alert, oriented, and feeling excellent
4. Allow a moment for full re-orientation before conversation

### Contraindications
- **Acute Psychotic Episodes**: Repeated state changes may exacerbate disorientation in psychotic states
- **Severe Dissociative Disorders**: The in-and-out cycling could trigger dissociative episodes in vulnerable individuals
- **Seizure Disorders**: Rapid state transitions may pose theoretical risk; obtain neurological clearance
- **Severe Anxiety About Loss of Control**: The rapid cycling can feel disorienting; subjects who fear loss of control may resist or panic
- **Substance Intoxication**: Altered baseline consciousness prevents reliable fractionation work
- **First Session with Highly Anxious Client**: Use more gradual methods until rapport and trust are established

### Cautions
- The technique requires practitioner confidence; hesitation during emergence-reinduction cycles can disrupt the process
- Some subjects may find the repeated opening and closing of eyes physically tiring; reduce cycles if fatigue is noted
- The rapid deepening can occasionally produce transient disorientation or heaviness; allow adequate emergence time
- Audio-only delivery (without visual calibration) requires additional verbal check-ins to confirm trance indicators
- A single fractionation cycle may not produce significant deepening (Frischholz & Spiegel, 1988); plan for 3-5 cycles
- Post-session debriefing is recommended as some subjects may be surprised by the depth achieved

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"You're resting comfortably now, eyes closed, beginning to relax. In a moment, I'm going to ask you to open your eyes briefly, and when you close them again, you'll go twice as deep. Ready? Open your eyes now. Good. Now close them and go twice as deep. That's right, sinking down, doubling that relaxation. Wonderful. And again -- open your eyes... and close them, going four times deeper now. Feel that wave pulling you down, deeper and deeper. And one more time -- open... and close. Eight times deeper. All the way down. Deeper than you've ever been."

- **Source**: Adapted from Dave Elman's Hypnotherapy (1964) and Vogt fractionation protocols
- **Context**: Core fractionation sequence with three cycles, demonstrating the emergence-reinduction pattern with compounding depth suggestions
- **Duration**: This excerpt covers approximately 60-90 seconds of a 4-minute deepening procedure

### Specific Language Patterns

1. **Doubling command**: "Close your eyes and go twice as deep as before."
2. **Compounding multiplier**: "Four times deeper... eight times deeper... sixteen times deeper..."
3. **Contrast amplification**: "Notice how much deeper you go each time you close your eyes."
4. **Rebound suggestion**: "Each time you open your eyes, it's like pulling back a slingshot -- when you close them, you go much further."
5. **Gravitational metaphor**: "Like a wave pulling you deeper with each cycle."
6. **Inevitability framing**: "Every time, deeper. It happens automatically."
7. **Speed escalation**: "Faster now... open... close... deeper. Open... close... deeper still."
8. **Confirmation pacing**: "That's right. You can feel it, can't you? Going deeper each time."
9. **Permission to depth**: "You don't have to try. The depth comes naturally with each cycle."
10. **Consolidation suggestion**: "And now, stay at this depth. Hold this level of deep, comfortable relaxation."

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can CLOSE YOUR EYES and GO DEEPER now."
- **Presuppositions**: "When you notice how much deeper the next cycle takes you..." (presupposes it will)
- **Temporal Predicates**: "Each time you close your eyes..." (creates temporal expectation)
- **Cause-Effect Linkage**: "Because you opened your eyes, closing them will take you twice as deep."
- **Truisms**: "You know how waking up and going back to sleep often feels even more restful the second time."
- **Binds**: "You can go deeper slowly, or you can go deeper quickly -- either way, you're going deeper."
- **Analogical Marking**: Voice drops lower and slower on "deeper," "down," "close" -- rises slightly on "open"

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Directive and confident during emergence commands ("Open your eyes"); soft and deep during re-induction ("Close them and go deeper"). The contrast in vocal quality mirrors the contrast in states.
- **Pacing**: Rhythmic and predictable. The open-close cycle should develop a musical quality. As cycles progress, the pace quickens slightly for emergence and slows for re-induction.
- **Emphasis**: Strong, clear emphasis on "open" and "close" as action commands. Soft, drawn-out emphasis on "deeper," "down," "relaxation."
- **Volume**: Normal conversational volume for emergence cues; progressively softer for deepening suggestions.
- **Timing**: Each cycle becomes slightly shorter than the previous one. First cycle: 20-25 seconds. Second: 15-20 seconds. Third: 10-15 seconds. Fourth: 8-10 seconds.
- **Confidence**: Critical to the technique. The practitioner must convey absolute certainty that each cycle will produce greater depth. Any hesitation signals uncertainty to the subject.
- **Rhythm**: Open... [pause]... close... deeper. Open... [shorter pause]... close... deeper. The accelerating rhythm creates momentum.

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Rapid trance deepening when time is limited, achieving somnambulistic depth reliably, deepening resistant or analytical subjects, building depth within the Elman Induction framework, pre-performance hypnosis where deep trance is needed quickly
- **Target Audience**: Athletes needing rapid deep trance for visualization or suggestion work, executives before high-stakes events, performers requiring pre-show state management, clinical hypnotherapy clients who plateau at light trance, experienced hypnotic subjects who need to go deeper faster
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Phase 2 of the Dave Elman Induction (eye-opening fractionation cycles)
  - Deepening an existing trance when initial induction produced only light relaxation
  - Pre-competition hypnosis sessions with time constraints (e.g., 10-minute pre-game window)
  - Building trance depth across multiple sessions (clients report going deeper each session)
  - Overcoming analytical resistance by rapidly cycling past the conscious mind's defenses
  - Clinical hypnotherapy requiring somnambulistic depth for regression or parts work
  - Training clients in self-hypnosis fractionation for independent practice

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Moderate
- **Rationale**: Fractionation has physiological evidence from Casiglia et al. (2012) demonstrating distinct and measurable neurophysiological changes during fractionation-based deepening, including increased precuneus alpha activity and significant hemodynamic changes. This is one of very few studies to directly compare deepening methods using objective physiological measures. The broader evidence base for hypnotic deepening is embedded within the general hypnosis efficacy literature, which is substantial (Milling et al., 2023: 49 meta-analyses, effects from d = 0.04 to d = 2.72). The Wolf et al. (2022) HypMol RCT included fractionation as part of the Elman protocol in a clinical trial. However, Frischholz & Spiegel (1988) found no significant differences between fractionation and silence conditions using a single cycle, which raises questions about dose-response and suggests that multiple cycles are necessary. The technique has strong face validity and is ubiquitous in clinical training, but direct RCT evidence isolating fractionation as an independent variable is limited. The Casiglia (2012) study provides the strongest specific evidence but with only 12 participants. Evidence is rated moderate because physiological mechanisms are demonstrated but direct outcomes data for fractionation as a specific technique remain limited.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Development
- The fractionation method was first described by Oskar Vogt in 1895, working with Krafft-Ebing at Alexandersbad
- Vogt and Brodmann developed the method as a systematic way to control and deepen hypnotic states
- Hippolyte Bernheim (1840-1919) observed that patients entered deeper trance states with each successive hypnosis visit, though he did not formalize this into a within-session technique
- Dave Elman (1900-1967) read Bernheim's work as a teenager and conceived of compressing the multi-visit deepening effect into rapid within-session cycles, calling it "Three Visits to Bernheim"
- Elman integrated fractionation as Phase 2 of his famous rapid induction, making it one of the most widely taught deepening methods in modern hypnotherapy
- Cal Banyan further refined the Elman approach, emphasizing fractionation as the critical deepening mechanism

### Mechanism Theories
- **Rebound Effect**: Each emergence creates a brief arousal that acts like pulling back a slingshot -- the subsequent re-induction produces greater relaxation rebound
- **State-Dependent Learning**: Each cycle reinforces the trance state pathway, making re-entry faster and deeper
- **Attentional Fatigue**: Repeated cycling exhausts the critical faculty's ability to maintain analytical vigilance
- **Compounding Suggestion**: The repeated suggestion of "going deeper" compounds across cycles, building cumulative suggestive force
- **Neural Pathway Strengthening**: Casiglia et al. (2012) found increased precuneus alpha after fractionation, suggesting specific neural pathway activation that may facilitate deeper states

### Relationship to Other Techniques
- **Dave Elman Induction**: Fractionation is a core component of the Elman Induction (Phase 2); the induction cannot be fully executed without it
- **Progressive Relaxation**: An alternative deepening approach; Casiglia (2012) showed it produces different physiological profiles
- **Countdown Breathing**: Can be combined -- fractionation cycles interspersed with countdown breathing segments
- **Staircase Deepener**: Different mechanism -- staircase uses continuous guided imagery descent while fractionation uses discrete state-change cycles
- **Post-Hypnotic Suggestion**: Fractionation creates the depth needed for reliable post-hypnotic suggestion installation
