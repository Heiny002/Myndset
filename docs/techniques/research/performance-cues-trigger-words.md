- **Title**: Self-Talk and Sports Performance: A Meta-Analysis
- **Journal**: Perspectives on Psychological Science, 6(4), 348-356
- **URL**: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691611413136
- **Key Findings**: Meta-analysis of 32 studies (62 effect sizes) revealed that self-talk cue interventions produce a moderate positive effect on sport performance. Instructional cue words (e.g., "smooth," "follow through") were more effective for fine motor tasks, while motivational cues (e.g., "push," "I can") were more effective for gross motor tasks requiring strength and endurance. Self-talk was more effective for novel tasks than well-learned tasks.
- **Effect Size**: Overall d = 0.48; Instructional cues d = 0.55, 95% CI [0.40, 0.70]; Motivational cues d = 0.37, 95% CI [0.25, 0.49]

- **Journal**: The Sport Psychologist, 14, 253-272
- **URL**: https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/tsp/14/3/article-p253.xml
- **Key Findings**: Established the self-talk matching hypothesis: instructional cue words are more effective for precision/accuracy tasks, while motivational cue words are more effective for strength/endurance tasks. Participants using assigned cue words outperformed no-self-talk controls across soccer shooting, badminton serving, sit-ups, and weighted leg extensions.
- **Effect Size**: Significant main effects for self-talk condition across all four motor tasks (p < .05)

- **URL**: https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/tsp/15/3/article-p306.xml
- **Key Findings**: Examined the where, when, what, and why of self-talk among 150 varsity athletes. Athletes used cue words both in practice and competition, at sporting venues and away from them. Two primary functions identified: cognitive-specific self-talk (individual skill execution) and cognitive-general self-talk (overall performance strategy and focus).
- **Effect Size**: Descriptive study; no intervention effect sizes reported

- **Key Findings**: Identified cue words as one of five primary psychological techniques for improving attentional skills in athletes. Trigger words function by narrowing attentional focus to task-relevant stimuli, reducing cognitive load, and allowing athletes to bypass overthinking by activating automatic motor patterns developed through training.
- **Effect Size**: Theoretical/review text; synthesises multiple empirical findings

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From Sport Psychology Practitioner Literature:**
1. Performance cues should be short (1-3 words), vivid, and positively phrased
2. Cues must be personally meaningful to the athlete and developed collaboratively
3. Instructional cues should match the specific technical demands of the task
4. Motivational cues should target energy, confidence, or effort regulation
5. Cue words should be rehearsed systematically in training before competitive use
6. Athletes should have no more than 3-5 active cue words to avoid cognitive overload

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Needs Assessment and Cue Selection**
1. Identify the athlete's performance demands (precision, power, endurance, focus)
2. Determine whether instructional or motivational cues are most appropriate
3. Collaboratively develop 2-4 short, vivid trigger words that resonate personally
4. Ensure cues are positively phrased (what TO do, not what to avoid)
5. Examples: "Smooth" (golf swing), "Explode" (sprint start), "This ball" (cricket batting)

**Phase 2: Cue Rehearsal in Training**
1. Introduce cue words during low-pressure training sessions
2. Athlete practices saying cue word silently or sotto voce before/during skill execution
3. Pair the cue word with successful execution to build association
4. Gradually increase practice intensity while maintaining cue usage
5. Track performance with and without cue usage to build confidence in the technique

**Phase 3: Competition Integration**
1. Establish when in the performance routine each cue word will be deployed
2. Practice using cues during simulated competition conditions
3. Develop a "cue card" or mental checklist for pre-performance review
4. Use cues as part of a broader pre-performance routine (deep breath + cue word)

**Phase 4: Refinement and Adaptation**
1. Review cue effectiveness after competitions
2. Modify or replace cues that lose meaning or effectiveness
3. Develop situation-specific cues (e.g., pressure moments, fatigue, adverse conditions)
4. Layer cues with other mental skills (imagery + cue word for compound effect)

### Contraindications
- **Clinical Anxiety Disorders**: Performance cues alone are insufficient for clinical-level performance anxiety; referral to clinical psychologist recommended
- **Obsessive Tendencies**: Athletes prone to obsessive thinking may ruminate on cue words rather than using them functionally; monitor for maladaptive self-talk patterns
- **Negative Self-Talk Entrenchment**: If athlete has deeply ingrained negative self-talk, direct cue word replacement may be resisted; address underlying beliefs first
- **Cognitive Overload**: Too many cue words simultaneously can increase rather than decrease cognitive load

### Cautions
- Cue words can become stale or lose meaning with overuse; refresh periodically
- Forced or externally imposed cue words are less effective than athlete-generated ones
- Effectiveness varies with skill level; elite athletes may benefit less from external cues
- Should not replace technical coaching or physical practice
- Works best as part of a comprehensive mental skills training programme

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"Before you step up to take that shot, I want you to take one focused breath and let a single word come to mind -- the word that captures exactly how you want to execute this. Maybe it's 'smooth,' maybe it's 'drive through.' Whatever that word is, let it fill your awareness for just a moment, then trust your body to do what it knows how to do. That word is your signal to your body: execute now."

- **Source**: Adapted from sport psychology practitioner guidelines
- **Context**: Used during initial cue word development session with an athlete

### Specific Language Patterns

**Cue Development Patterns:**
1. "What one word captures how you feel when you're performing at your best?"
2. "If you could give your body a single instruction right before you go, what would it be?"
3. "Think of the best performance you've ever had. What word would you use to describe that feeling?"
4. "When everything clicks into place, what does that look like in one word?"

**Cue Activation Patterns:**
5. "As you take your breath, let [cue word] drop into your mind like a stone into still water..."
6. "Say [cue word] silently, and let your body respond..."
7. "One word. One breath. Then go."
8. "Let [cue word] be the last thing in your mind before you execute..."

**Reinforcement Patterns:**
9. "That's exactly it -- you said [cue word] and your body knew exactly what to do."
10. "Notice how [cue word] brings you right back to that zone of focus."

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You might find that as you say that word to yourself, your body begins to respond automatically..."
- **Presuppositions**: "When you find the right trigger word..." (presupposes they will find it)
- **Nominalizations**: "That sense of focus... that feeling of readiness..."
- **Process Language**: "As that word settles into your awareness, notice what shifts..."

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Confident, direct, and energised -- matching the action-oriented nature of the technique
- **Pacing**: Quick and rhythmic when demonstrating cue deployment; slower when developing and exploring cue words
- **Emphasis**: Stress the cue word itself when modelling; use tonal marking to distinguish cue words from surrounding language
- **Duration**: 2-5 minutes for cue deployment; 15-20 minutes for initial cue development session
- **Volume**: Match the intensity of the sport context; louder for power sports, quieter for precision sports

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Instant attentional focus, technical execution under pressure, energy regulation, confidence activation
- **Target Audience**: Athletes across all sports, military personnel, surgeons, performing artists, executives preparing for high-stakes presentations
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Pre-shot routine in golf, basketball free throws, tennis serves
  - Sprint starts and explosive movement initiation
  - Refocusing after errors or distractions during competition
  - Managing fatigue in endurance events
  - Confidence restoration during high-pressure moments
  - Technical correction during training sessions

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Strong
- **Rationale**: The Hatzigeorgiadis et al. (2011) meta-analysis of 32 studies provides robust evidence for the effectiveness of self-talk cue interventions (d = 0.48), with the finding replicated across diverse sports and task types. The self-talk matching hypothesis (Theodorakis et al., 2000) provides clear guidelines for practitioners regarding cue type selection. The technique is widely adopted across elite sport, military, and performance psychology settings. While some moderating variables require further investigation (particularly effectiveness with elite vs. novice athletes), the overall evidence base is strong and the technique carries minimal risk.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Development
- Performance cues emerge from the broader self-talk literature in sport psychology
- Roots in cognitive-behavioural theory: thoughts influence emotions and behaviour
- Influenced by attentional control theory (Nideffer, 1976) and concentration research (Moran, 1996)
- Used extensively in military performance psychology (US Army, Navy SEALs)
- Also adopted in surgical training and high-reliability organisation performance

### Related Techniques
- **Self-Talk Restructuring**: Replacing negative self-talk with positive cue words
- **Attentional Focus Training**: Broader framework within which cue words operate
- **Pre-Performance Routines**: Cue words are commonly embedded within structured routines
- **Anchoring (NLP)**: Conceptually related technique pairing a stimulus with a desired state
- **Imagery + Cue Word Pairing**: Combining visual rehearsal with verbal trigger for compound effect

### Practical Considerations
- Athletes should practice cue words hundreds of times in training before relying on them in competition
- Written cue cards placed in equipment bags or on equipment can serve as visual reminders
- Cue words can be whispered, spoken silently, or even written on athletic tape
- Digital reminders (phone lock screen, pre-game playlist titles) can reinforce cues
- Coaches can use shared cue words with athletes for efficient sideline communication
