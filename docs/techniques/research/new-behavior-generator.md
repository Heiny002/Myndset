### Primary Source: Mental Practice Meta-Analysis
- **Authors**: Driskell, J. E., Copper, C., & Moran, A.
- **Year**: 1994
- **Title**: Does Mental Practice Enhance Performance?
- **Journal**: Journal of Applied Psychology, 79(4), 481-492
- **URL**: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228118007_Does_Mental_Practice_Enhance_Performance
- **Key Findings**: Landmark meta-analysis examining the effect of mental practice (cognitive rehearsal of a task prior to performance) on subsequent performance. Found that mental practice has a positive and significant effect on performance. The effectiveness was moderated by task type (more effective for tasks with high cognitive components), retention interval (benefits diminish over time without physical practice), and duration of mental practice (optimal around 20 minutes). Mental practice was especially effective for tasks involving decision-making, communication, and problem-solving.

- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29809020/
- **Key Findings**: Meta-analysis examining imagery and mental simulation interventions for behavior change. Found that mental simulation interventions had significant positive effects on behavior. Process simulations (imagining the steps of performing a behavior) were more effective than outcome simulations (imagining the end result). Provides support for the core mechanism of the New Behavior Generator -- that mentally rehearsing behavioral steps translates to improved real-world performance.

- **Title**: Synthesizing the Effects of Mental Simulation on Behavior Change: Systematic Review and Multilevel Meta-Analysis
- **Journal**: Psychonomic Bulletin & Review
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8500882/
- **Key Findings**: Comprehensive systematic review identifying 123 effect sizes (N = 5,685) comparing mental simulation to control groups. Found a statistically reliable positive effect of mental simulation on behavior. Superior simulations (imagining excellent performance) produced more reliable beneficial effects than standard simulations. Using a taxonomy of simulation types (process, performance, outcome), the study demonstrated that the way mental rehearsal is structured significantly impacts its effectiveness.

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From NLP Sources and Mental Practice Research:**
1. The New Behavior Generator uses a structured three-step process: dissociated visual rehearsal, associated kinesthetic rehearsal, and real-world integration
2. The initial visualization should be dissociated (watching yourself from the outside) to allow objective evaluation and refinement of the behavior
3. The subsequent association step (stepping into the image) connects the visual template to kinesthetic experience, creating a felt sense of the new behavior
4. The technique draws on the same neural mechanisms as physical practice -- motor cortex activation during mental rehearsal (functional equivalence hypothesis)
5. Multiple sensory modalities should be engaged for maximum effectiveness (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
6. The generated behavior should be ecologically valid -- realistic and achievable within the client's current capabilities
7. Mental rehearsal is most effective when combined with eventual physical practice

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Identify the Desired Behavior (1 minute)**
1. Clearly define the specific new behavior the client wants to develop
2. Ask: "What exactly do you want to be able to do? In what context? With whom?"
3. Ensure the behavior is specific, observable, and achievable
4. Establish sensory-based evidence: "How will you know when you're doing it successfully?"
5. Check ecology: "Is there any part of you that objects to having this new behavior?"

**Phase 2: Dissociated Visual Construction (1-2 minutes)**
1. Ask the client to create a mental movie of themselves performing the desired behavior -- watching from the outside, as if on a screen
2. "Watch yourself doing this new behavior perfectly. See how you stand, how you move, how you interact."
3. If the client cannot generate the image, use a model: "Think of someone who does this brilliantly. Watch them. Now put your face on that image."
4. Refine the movie: adjust posture, timing, facial expression, voice tone, body language
5. Run the movie from start to finish, ensuring all details are satisfying
6. Repeat and refine until the client reports the visual representation is exactly right

**Phase 3: Associated Kinesthetic Rehearsal (1-2 minutes)**
1. "Now step INTO that image. See through your own eyes. Hear through your own ears. Feel what it feels like to do this."
2. Guide the client to run through the entire behavior sequence from the inside
3. "Notice the sensations in your body as you perform this new behavior. Feel the confidence, the ease, the naturalness."
4. If any part feels wrong or uncomfortable, step back out to dissociated view, adjust, and re-associate
5. Run the full associated rehearsal 2-3 times until it feels natural and automatic
6. Amplify the positive feelings: "Turn up the intensity of those good feelings"

**Phase 4: Auditory Enhancement (30-60 seconds)**
1. Add the auditory component: "What do you say to yourself as you perform this behavior?"
2. Refine the internal dialogue: tone, volume, pace
3. Add external sounds if relevant (audience response, environment)
4. Ensure the auditory track supports and reinforces the behavior

**Phase 5: Integration and Future Pacing (30-60 seconds)**
1. "Now think of the next time you'll be in a situation where this new behavior would be useful."
2. "See yourself in that specific future situation, performing this behavior naturally and automatically."
3. Run the full associated rehearsal in the future context
4. Set an environmental trigger: "What will you see or hear that will remind you to activate this new behavior?"
5. Test: "How does it feel to know you have this new behavior available to you?"

### Contraindications
- **Active Psychosis**: Visualization work requires intact reality testing
- **Severe Dissociative Disorders**: The dissociation/association steps may be destabilizing for clients with existing dissociative conditions
- **Behaviors Requiring Physical Training**: Mental rehearsal alone cannot replace physical skill development for complex motor tasks; use as a complement to physical practice
- **Unrealistic Behavioral Goals**: The generated behavior must be within the client's physical and psychological capacity

### Cautions
- Mental rehearsal is most effective when combined with actual physical practice of the behavior
- Clients with poor visualization ability may need auditory or kinesthetic alternatives
- The technique generates behavioral templates, not deep psychological change -- underlying beliefs may still need to be addressed
- Avoid using for behaviors that would be harmful to the client or others
- Multiple sessions may be needed for complex behavioral patterns
- The generated behavior should be tested in low-stakes environments before high-pressure situations

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"I'd like you to imagine a movie screen in front of you. On that screen, watch a version of yourself who already has this new behavior -- see how they stand, how they move, how they communicate. Notice the confidence in their posture, the clarity in their voice. Adjust anything that doesn't look quite right until it's exactly the performance you want. Good. Now, when that image is perfect, I want you to float right into it. Step behind your own eyes. See what you see. Hear what you hear. And most importantly -- feel what it feels like to actually be doing this. Run through the whole sequence from the inside now."

- **Source**: Adapted from NLP Practitioner training materials; Dilts, R. (1998). NLP Pattern catalog at NLPU.com
- **Context**: Used during the transition from dissociated observation to associated experience in the New Behavior Generator
- **Duration**: 3-4 minutes for the complete guided sequence

### Specific Language Patterns

1. "Watch a version of yourself on that screen who already does this perfectly..." (dissociated visual construction)
2. "Adjust the image until it looks exactly right -- posture, timing, expression..." (refinement language)
3. "If you can't see yourself doing it yet, think of someone who does it brilliantly and borrow their template..." (modeling alternative)
4. "Now step INTO that image -- see through your own eyes, feel through your own body..." (association command)
5. "Run through it again from the inside, letting the feelings become stronger each time..." (kinesthetic amplification)
6. "Your nervous system doesn't distinguish between a vividly imagined experience and a real one..." (functional equivalence principle)
7. "Each time you rehearse this mentally, the neural pathways get stronger..." (neuroplasticity framing)
8. "Notice how natural this feels already -- as if you've done it many times before..." (presupposition of competence)
9. "This is your dress rehearsal -- and when the real moment comes, your body will know exactly what to do..." (future pacing)
10. "The more vivid you make this rehearsal, the more powerful the transfer to real life..." (engagement motivation)

### Milton Model Elements
- **Presupposition**: "When you step into this new behavior..." -- presupposes they will step in
- **Embedded Command**: "You can FEEL CONFIDENT and MOVE NATURALLY as you practice this now"
- **Nominalization**: "This new capability" -- turns a complex behavioral pattern into a simple noun
- **Pacing and Leading**: "You're imagining this screen now... and as the image becomes clearer... you begin to notice how ready you are to step in..."
- **Truism**: "Everyone learns new behaviors by first imagining themselves doing them..." -- builds agreement
- **Metaphor**: "Like an architect's blueprint becomes a building, your mental rehearsal becomes your natural behavior..."
- **Double Bind**: "You can step into that image now, or take a moment to make it even more perfect first..."

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Encouraging, curious, and supportive throughout. Slightly more energized during the association phase to help the client fully embody the experience. Calm and exploratory during the dissociated construction phase.
- **Pacing**: Slow and spacious during the visual construction phase to allow detailed image building. Moderate pace during association to match the flow of the rehearsed behavior. Strategic pauses after each instruction to allow processing.
- **Emphasis**: Stress sensory words ("see," "hear," "feel") to engage all representational systems. Emphasize "step in" and "through your own eyes" at the critical dissociation-to-association transition.
- **Duration**: Full technique: 4-6 minutes. Dissociated construction: 1-2 minutes. Associated rehearsal: 1-2 minutes. Integration: 1 minute.
- **Volume**: Moderate throughout. Slightly softer during visualization construction (to support internal focus). Slightly more energized during associated rehearsal.
- **Pauses**: 3-5 second pauses after visualization instructions to allow image formation. Brief pauses between sensory channel prompts (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Moderate
- **Rationale**: The New Behavior Generator combines well-established mental practice principles (supported by multiple meta-analyses with moderate effect sizes) with NLP-specific techniques for structuring the rehearsal process. While the specific NLP format has limited direct empirical testing, the underlying mechanism of mental rehearsal has robust scientific support.

**Strengths:**
1. Mental practice meta-analysis (Driskell et al., 1994, d = 0.527) provides solid foundation for the core mechanism
2. Updated meta-analysis (Toth et al., 2020) confirms sustained positive effects across 24 years of additional research
3. Mental simulation meta-analysis (Gammon & Hagger, 2021, g = 0.49, N = 5,685) demonstrates behavior change effects
4. Process simulations (rehearsing steps) shown to be more effective than outcome simulations -- consistent with NBG's step-by-step approach
5. Low risk of adverse effects when properly implemented
6. Integrates naturally with physical practice for enhanced learning
7. Applicable across diverse behavioral domains (motor, social, cognitive, emotional)

**Limitations:**
1. No published RCTs specifically testing the NLP New Behavior Generator format
2. The specific contribution of the dissociation/association steps (beyond general mental rehearsal) is not empirically isolated
3. NLP evidence base has been criticized for methodological weaknesses
4. Mental rehearsal alone is less effective than combined mental-physical practice
5. Effectiveness depends on the client's visualization capacity
6. Benefits may diminish over time without reinforcement through physical practice

**Conclusion**: The New Behavior Generator has moderate evidence based on the strong foundation of mental practice research combined with emerging NLP-specific evidence. The core mechanism (mental rehearsal enhancing performance) is well-established; the NLP-specific structuring elements (dissociation, association, submodality refinement) add a practical framework that is theoretically sound but requires more direct empirical validation.

## Additional Notes

### Theoretical Foundation
The New Behavior Generator draws on several established psychological principles:
- **Functional Equivalence Hypothesis**: Mental imagery activates similar neural pathways to actual physical execution (Jeannerod, 1995)
- **PETTLEP Model**: Physical, Environment, Task, Timing, Learning, Emotion, Perspective -- all factors that affect the quality of mental rehearsal (Holmes & Collins, 2001)
- **Motor Simulation Theory**: The brain uses internal models to simulate action outcomes, and this simulation contributes to motor learning
- **State-Dependent Memory**: Associating into the experience creates state-dependent encoding that facilitates behavioral recall in context

### Historical Development
- **Late 1970s**: John Grinder develops the basic steps of the New Behavior Generator as part of NLP modeling methodology
- **1980s**: Richard Bandler refines the technique with explicit submodality and representational system components
- **1985**: Published in Bandler's "Using Your Brain -- For a Change" alongside other NLP techniques
- **1990s-2000s**: Becomes a standard component of NLP Practitioner certification programs worldwide
- **2000s-present**: Mental practice research increasingly validates the underlying mechanisms

### Key Principles
- **Dissociation First, Association Second**: Watching from outside allows editing and refinement; stepping inside creates embodied learning
- **Modeling as Resource**: If the client cannot generate the behavior, borrow from a model and adapt
- **Multi-Sensory Engagement**: Effective rehearsal engages visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems
- **Ecological Testing**: Always check that the new behavior fits the client's life context and values
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple rehearsals with progressive refinement produce stronger installation

### Relationship to Other Techniques
- **Mental Imagery/Visualization**: The NBG is a structured application of mental imagery with specific NLP-based steps
- **Swish Pattern**: The swish replaces unwanted patterns; the NBG generates entirely new ones. They complement each other.
- **Anchoring**: Can anchor the optimal state experienced during associated rehearsal for later access
- **Circle of Excellence**: Can spatially anchor the new behavior for on-demand access
- **Modeling (NLP)**: If the client lacks a reference experience, NLP modeling provides a source template for the new behavior
