- **Title**: Plans and the Structure of Behavior
- **Journal**: Holt, Rinehart and Winston
- **URL**: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16328-000
- **Key Findings**: Introduced the TOTE (Test-Operate-Test-Exit) model as a fundamental unit of planned behavior, replacing the simple stimulus-response model. Proposed that all goal-directed behavior follows a feedback loop: test the current state against the desired state, operate to change conditions, test again, and exit when the goal is achieved. This model became the foundation for NLP strategy work when Dilts, Grinder, Bandler, and DeLozier (1980) adapted it to include representational systems, submodalities, and eye accessing cues.
- **Effect Size**: Theoretical framework; foundational to cognitive psychology and cybernetics

- **Year**: 1980
- **Title**: Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Volume I: The Study of the Structure of Subjective Experience
- **Journal**: Meta Publications
- **URL**: https://www.nlpcoaching.com/nlp-strategies-the-mind-body-connection-to-behavior/
- **Key Findings**: Formalized the NLP Strategy Model by enhancing the TOTE framework with representational system coding (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, gustatory). Established strategy elicitation as a systematic process for mapping the internal sequence of sensory representations that produce specific behavioral outcomes. Introduced the concept that every behavior is the product of a specific strategy that can be elicited, modeled, and installed in others. This work is considered the primary reference manual for NLP strategy work.
- **Effect Size**: Practitioner framework; no controlled trials conducted

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From NLP Practitioner Training and the Strategy Model (Dilts et al., 1980):**
1. Strategy elicitation is a systematic process for discovering the precise sequence of internal representations (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) that produce a specific result in an expert performer
2. The TOTE model provides the structural framework: Test (compare current state to desired state), Operate (run the strategy), Test (check result), Exit (strategy complete)
3. Elicitation must capture not just the representational systems used but also submodalities (brightness, volume, pressure) and the sequencing/timing of each step
4. The technique assumes that excellence is structured and transferable -- if one person can do something, the internal strategy can be mapped and taught to others
5. Installation requires matching the representational system preferences of the learner, not just copying the steps
6. Strategy elicitation works best when the exemplar is in an associated state (reliving the experience) rather than dissociated (analyzing it from outside)
7. Multiple exemplars should be elicited to identify the common essential elements versus individual variations

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Identify the Target Skill and Select Exemplar (1-2 minutes)**
1. Define the specific skill or behavior to be modeled (e.g., "making confident decisions under pressure," "entering a flow state for public speaking")
2. Identify a person who consistently demonstrates excellence in this area (can be the client themselves in a different context, or an external model)
3. If self-modeling: identify a specific time the client performed this skill at their best
4. Clarify the context: "In what specific situation does this strategy activate?"
5. Establish rapport and explain the elicitation process

**Phase 2: Access the State and Elicit the Strategy (2-3 minutes)**
1. Guide the exemplar to fully re-associate into the experience: "Go back to a specific time when you did this brilliantly. Step into it now, seeing through your own eyes..."
2. Ask the trigger question: "What is the very first thing that happens internally when you begin to [target skill]? Do you see something, hear something, or feel something first?"
3. Track the representational sequence using eye accessing cues and sensory predicates
4. For each step, probe for submodalities: "When you see that image, is it big or small? Bright or dim? Close or far away?"
5. Map the complete sequence: "And then what happens next? After you see/hear/feel that, what's the next internal step?"
6. Continue until the full TOTE is mapped from trigger through to successful completion
7. Check for decision points: "Is there a moment where you check whether it's working? What tells you it's on track?"

**Phase 3: Codify the Strategy (30-60 seconds)**
1. Read back the complete strategy sequence to the exemplar for verification
2. Notation example: V^e (external visual) -> A^i (internal auditory dialogue) -> K^i (internal kinesthetic check) -> V^c (constructed visual image) -> K^i+ (positive feeling = exit)
3. Identify the critical steps that distinguish this strategy from less effective ones
4. Note the key submodalities at each step that amplify effectiveness
5. Confirm with exemplar: "Does this accurately capture what happens inside when you do this well?"

**Phase 4: Install the Strategy in the Learner (2-3 minutes)**
1. Explain the strategy sequence to the learner in their own representational system preferences
2. Guide them through each step: "First, I'd like you to create a picture in your mind of..."
3. At each step, help them calibrate the submodalities: "Make that image bigger and brighter, just as [exemplar] does"
4. Use future pacing: "Imagine yourself in [target situation] next week, and run this strategy from the beginning..."
5. Test the installation: place the learner in a simulated context and observe if the strategy fires naturally
6. Refine any steps that don't flow smoothly
7. Anchor the strategy to an appropriate trigger for automatic activation

**Phase 5: Integration and Practice (1-2 minutes)**
1. Have the learner mentally rehearse the strategy 3-5 times in different contexts
2. Identify potential interference from old, less effective strategies
3. Establish a practice schedule for the next 7-14 days
4. Create environmental triggers that will remind the learner to activate the new strategy
5. Schedule a follow-up to assess strategy integration and make adjustments

### Contraindications
- **Active Psychosis or Severe Dissociative States**: The guided introspection required for strategy elicitation may be destabilizing
- **Severe Untreated Mental Illness**: Should not be used as a substitute for evidence-based psychological treatment
- **Acute Trauma**: Accessing peak performance states may inadvertently trigger traumatic memories if the skill is associated with a traumatic context
- **Cognitive Impairment**: Requires the ability to track and report internal experience in real time

### Cautions
- Strategy elicitation requires NLP Practitioner-level training for effective execution
- Some individuals are not skilled at introspecting on their internal processes; patience and calibration are needed
- The installed strategy may not transfer perfectly on the first attempt; expect iterative refinement
- Cultural and individual differences mean strategies are not universally transferable; adaptation is usually required
- Strategy elicitation is part of the broader NLP modeling process; strategies alone do not capture beliefs, values, or physiology
- Audio-only delivery is possible but reduces access to visual calibration cues (eye movements, posture shifts)

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"I'd like you to think of a specific time when you made a brilliant decision under pressure -- a time when everything just clicked and you knew exactly what to do. Step into that moment now, seeing through your own eyes, hearing the sounds around you. Good. Now tell me: what is the very first thing that happens inside when that decision-making process begins? Is it a picture? A voice? A feeling? Take your time and notice the very first internal signal..."

- **Source**: Adapted from NLP Practitioner strategy elicitation protocols (Dilts et al., 1980; Bandler & Grinder, 1979)
- **Context**: Opening phase of strategy elicitation when accessing the exemplar's peak performance state
- **Duration**: This excerpt covers approximately the first 60-90 seconds of the elicitation phase

### Specific Language Patterns

1. **Trigger identification**: "What is the very first thing that happens inside when you begin to [skill]?"
2. **Representational system probe**: "Do you see something, hear something, or feel something first?"
3. **Submodality calibration**: "When you see that image, how big is it? How bright? Where is it located in your visual field?"
4. **Sequence tracking**: "And after you [see/hear/feel] that, what happens next inside?"
5. **Decision point probe**: "Is there a moment where you check whether this is working? What tells you you're on track?"
6. **Installation bridge**: "Now I'd like you to create that same kind of image in your mind -- make it the same size, the same brightness..."
7. **Future pacing**: "Imagine yourself next week in [target situation], and let this new strategy run automatically from the beginning..."
8. **Confirmation check**: "Does this accurately capture what happens inside when you do this brilliantly?"
9. **Amplification**: "Turn up the intensity of that feeling. Make the image even brighter and closer. Hear that internal voice with even more certainty."
10. **Exit confirmation**: "And when you notice that positive feeling -- that signal that says 'yes, this is right' -- that's how you know the strategy is complete."

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can BEGIN TO NOTICE what happens inside as you ACCESS THAT STATE of excellence."
- **Presuppositions**: "When you discover the first step in your strategy..." (presupposes they will discover it)
- **Temporal Predicates**: "As you become more aware of this pattern, you'll find it activating more quickly each time."
- **Pacing and Leading**: "You're sitting here now, thinking about that experience, and already your mind is beginning to reveal the sequence..."
- **Truisms**: "Everyone has strategies for the things they do well -- we're simply making yours visible so they can be used on purpose."
- **Nominalization**: "This excellence, this capability, this brilliance you've demonstrated -- it has a structure we can map."
- **Double Binds**: "You might notice the visual component first, or perhaps the feeling comes first -- either way, you're already discovering your strategy."

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Curious, precise, and encouraging. The practitioner is an explorer mapping territory, not a lecturer. Genuine fascination with the exemplar's internal experience communicates respect and deepens rapport.
- **Pacing**: Moderate during elicitation questions; allow generous pauses for the client to introspect. During installation, match the natural tempo of the strategy being installed -- if the strategy is fast and decisive, maintain energy; if it is contemplative, slow down.
- **Emphasis**: Mark representational system words with subtle vocal emphasis ("What do you SEE? What do you HEAR?"). During installation, emphasize submodality instructions ("Make it BIGGER, BRIGHTER, CLOSER").
- **Volume**: Conversational throughout. Slightly softer during introspective moments to avoid disrupting the client's internal process.
- **Observation**: Watch for eye accessing cues (eyes moving up-left for visual recalled, down-right for kinesthetic) to verify the representational systems the client reports. Calibrate to breathing, posture, and facial expression changes that indicate state access.
- **Timing**: Full strategy elicitation and installation: 15-25 minutes. Abbreviated version for a familiar skill: 5-10 minutes. The audio-guided version focuses on self-elicitation and self-installation.

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Emerging
- **Rationale**: Strategy elicitation is grounded in the TOTE model from cognitive psychology (Miller, Galanter, & Pribram, 1960), which has solid theoretical foundations. The NLP adaptation by Dilts et al. (1980) added representational system coding but was not subjected to controlled empirical testing. The Zaharia et al. (2015) meta-analysis found a medium effect size (d = 0.54) for NLP psychotherapy interventions generally, though strategy elicitation was not isolated as a separate variable. Kotera et al. (2019) found positive but methodologically limited evidence for NLP in organizational settings. The broader expert performance literature (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Romer, 1993) supports the concept that expert strategies are structured and can be taught, though the specific NLP elicitation methodology has not been validated through rigorous controlled trials. The evidence is rated emerging because: (1) the theoretical foundation is sound, (2) practitioner experience spanning 40+ years is extensive, (3) but peer-reviewed empirical validation of the specific strategy elicitation protocol remains limited.

**Strengths:**
1. Grounded in the TOTE model, a well-established framework from cognitive psychology
2. Aligns with expertise research showing that expert performance has identifiable cognitive components
3. Widely taught and practiced in NLP Practitioner and Master Practitioner training worldwide
4. Flexible and adaptable to virtually any skill domain
5. Can be used for both self-modeling (accessing one's own best) and other-modeling (learning from experts)

**Limitations:**
1. No published RCTs specifically testing strategy elicitation as an isolated intervention
2. NLP representational system preferences (VAK) have been critiqued for oversimplifying cognition
3. Eye accessing cue patterns have not been reliably validated in controlled studies
4. The quality of the elicitation depends heavily on practitioner skill and the exemplar's introspective ability
5. Transfer from elicited strategy to real-world performance has not been systematically measured

### Mechanism of Action
**How Strategy Elicitation Works:**
1. **Representational Mapping**: Maps the exact sequence of internal sensory representations (images, sounds, feelings) that produce a specific outcome
2. **Submodality Precision**: Captures the qualitative features of each representation (size, brightness, volume, pressure) that drive the emotional and cognitive impact
3. **TOTE Feedback Loop**: Identifies the test-operate-test-exit cycle that governs when the strategy continues operating and when it exits successfully
4. **Cross-Context Transfer**: Enables the strategy to be installed in new situations where the same cognitive pattern would produce excellent results
5. **Implicit-to-Explicit Conversion**: Makes unconscious competence conscious, allowing it to be refined, taught, and deliberately deployed

### Relationship to Other Techniques
- **Anchoring (NLP)**: An installed strategy can be anchored to a physical trigger for rapid activation
- **Mental Imagery**: Strategy installation relies heavily on guided visualization at each step
- **Positive Self-Talk**: The auditory-internal component of many strategies involves specific self-talk patterns
- **Circle of Excellence**: Spatial anchoring can be used to install and activate a modeled strategy
- **Stacking Anchors**: Multiple strategies or strategy components can be layered onto a single trigger
