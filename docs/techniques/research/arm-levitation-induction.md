## Academic Sources

### Primary Source: Stanford Hypnotic Arm Levitation Induction and Test (SHALIT)
- **Authors**: Hilgard, E. R., Crawford, H. J., Bowers, P., & Kihlstrom, J. F.
- **Year**: 1979
- **Title**: The Stanford Hypnotic Arm Levitation Induction and Test (SHALIT): A Six-Minute Hypnotic Induction and Measurement Scale
- **Journal**: International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, 27(2), 111-124
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/541129/
- **Key Findings**: Developed and validated a standardized arm levitation induction that serves simultaneously as a hypnotic induction, a deepener, and a hypnotizability measurement tool, all within six minutes. The SHALIT levitation score correlated 0.63 with SHSS:A in one experiment and 0.52 with SHSS:C in a second experiment. Demonstrated that arm levitation as an induction method reliably produces measurable hypnotic responsiveness and can serve as both induction and assessment in a single procedure.
- **Effect Size**: r = 0.63 correlation with SHSS:A; r = 0.52 correlation with SHSS:C

### Supporting Studies

**The Role of Tactile Support in Arm Levitation**
- **Authors**: Banyai, E. I., Varga, K., & Gosi-Greguss, A. C.
- **Year**: 2013
- **Title**: The Role of Tactile Support in Arm Levitation
- **Journal**: American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, 56(2), 103-120
- **URL**: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00029157.2012.702701
- **Key Findings**: When hypnotic arm levitation was suggested three times consecutively to 30 medium-suggestible students, 16 succeeded without any tactile support, 7 needed it one or two times, 5 needed it every time, and 2 achieved no arm levitation at all. Participants without tactile support went more quickly into deeper hypnosis, experienced more involuntariness, less effort, and had higher electrodermal activity. Greater physiological activity appeared necessary for hypnotic arm levitation as a form of "attentive hypnosis" in contrast to "relaxation hypnosis."
- **Effect Size**: 53% success without support; 77% with minimal support; significant differences in depth and involuntariness

**Ideomotor Signaling Historical Perspective**
- **Authors**: Ewin, D. M., & Eimer, B. N.
- **Year**: 2006
- **Title**: Ideomotor Signals for Rapid Hypnoanalysis: A How-To Manual
- **Journal**: Charles C. Thomas Publisher
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21404952/
- **Key Findings**: Comprehensive review of ideomotor signaling in hypnosis, establishing that ideomotor responses are motor reactions preceded by a conscious or subconscious thought. The intention or thought is transmitted to the motor cortex at a subconscious level, coordinated by the cerebellum, and sent down spinal nerves to the appropriate muscles. Clinical studies demonstrate a 78% success rate of ideomotor signaling in eliciting involuntary responses during therapy. Arm levitation represents the most dramatic and convincing form of ideomotor response for both practitioner and subject.
- **Effect Size**: 78% clinical success rate for ideomotor signaling

- **Journal**: bioRxiv (preprint)
- **URL**: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.11.652707v2.full
- **Key Findings**: EEG results revealed that light hypnosis was associated with early parieto-occipital alpha suppression and increased theta-band activity. As hypnosis deepened, frontoparietal connectivity increased in the theta band while parasympathetic activation declined, pointing to active top-down reorganization of large-scale brain networks. Ideomotor suggestions (like arm levitation) produced distinct neural signatures compared to direct motor suggestions, confirming that the subjective experience of involuntariness has a measurable neurological basis.
- **Effect Size**: Significant EEG differences between voluntary and ideomotor movement conditions

- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10807512/
- **Key Findings**: Overview of 49 meta-analyses encompassing 261 distinct primary studies. Hypnosis interventions showed effect sizes ranging from d = -0.04 to d = 2.72, with the most robust evidence for medical procedures and pain management. Various induction methods were used across studies, including arm levitation approaches. Seven applications rated "highly effective": stress reduction, well-being, surgery preparation, anxiety, mindfulness, childbirth, and confidence enhancement.
- **Effect Size**: Pain: d = 0.54-0.80; Procedural anxiety: d = 0.40-1.20

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From Erickson & Rossi (1979), Hilgard et al. (1979), and Contemporary Hypnotherapy Practice:**
1. The arm levitation induction uses the suggestion of an arm floating upward as both the induction method and a trance ratifier -- the subject's experience of involuntary arm movement confirms trance to both practitioner and subject
2. The technique leverages the ideomotor response: unconscious micro-muscle activations produced by imagined or suggested movements
3. Milton Erickson developed the most influential version of this induction, using indirect suggestion and permissive language to facilitate the experience of involuntariness
4. The arm levitation is simultaneously an induction, a deepener, and a trance ratifier -- as the arm rises, trance deepens; when the arm reaches the face, deep trance is confirmed
5. This induction is particularly effective for subjects who are kinesthetically oriented (prefer feeling-based experience)
6. The induction typically takes 4-6 minutes, though Erickson's classic version could extend to 15-20 minutes for therapeutic purposes
7. Success rate varies with suggestibility: approximately 53-77% of medium-suggestible subjects achieve full arm levitation

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Preparation and Hand Placement (30-45 seconds)**
1. Instruct the subject to sit comfortably with both hands resting on their thighs, palms down
2. Guide attention to the hands: "I'd like you to focus all your attention on your hands resting on your thighs"
3. Build expectancy: "In a moment, you're going to notice some interesting sensations beginning in one of your hands"
4. Suggest awareness: "You might notice the weight of your hands... the warmth where they touch your legs... perhaps a slight tingling or pulsing"
5. Set the frame: "One of your hands -- you don't yet know which one -- is going to begin to feel different from the other"

**Phase 2: Suggesting Differential Sensation (1-2 minutes)**
1. "Notice which hand feels lighter than the other. It might be your right hand... or your left hand. One of them is beginning to feel lighter."
2. "Perhaps you notice a tingling in the fingertips of that lighter hand... a sense of lightness spreading through the fingers... as if the air beneath your hand is becoming warmer, like a warm cushion of air beginning to lift..."
3. "And as that lightness increases, you might notice the fingers of that hand beginning to twitch slightly... tiny involuntary movements... the first signs that your unconscious mind is responding..."
4. "That's right... those small movements becoming a little larger... the spaces between your fingers widening slightly... the fingers beginning to separate and lift..."
5. Watch for the first genuine micro-movements and immediately reinforce them: "That's exactly right... your unconscious mind is already responding..."

**Phase 3: Arm Levitation and Trance Deepening (2-3 minutes)**
1. "And now that hand is beginning to lift... slowly, gently, all on its own... your fingers lifting off your thigh... the back of your hand following..."
2. "With every inch that hand rises, you go deeper into trance. The higher the hand rises, the deeper you go."
3. "It doesn't matter how slowly it moves... your unconscious mind has its own pace... let it rise at whatever speed feels right..."
4. "Rising higher and higher... lighter and lighter... floating upward as if a gentle string is attached to your wrist, pulling it softly toward the ceiling..."
5. "And as that hand continues to rise, your eyes might feel heavy... heavier and heavier... wanting to close... and when they close, you'll go even deeper..."
6. Continue reinforcing the upward movement and linking it to deepening trance
7. If the arm stalls, suggest: "And even as it pauses there, the lightness continues to build... preparing for the next upward movement..."

**Phase 4: Trance Ratification and Transition (30-60 seconds)**
1. "Your hand is now rising toward your face... and when it touches your face, you'll be in a deep, comfortable trance, ready for the important work we're going to do together."
2. As the hand approaches the face: "That's right... closer and closer... deeper and deeper..."
3. When hand touches face: "And as your hand gently touches your face, you can let it drift back down to your lap, and as it settles down, you go even deeper into that comfortable, focused state."
4. Allow the hand to lower and rest: "Wonderful. Your hand returning to rest... and you are now deeply, comfortably absorbed in this experience."

**Phase 5: Utilization and Emergence**
1. With trance confirmed through the levitation response, transition to therapeutic or performance work
2. The ideomotor response has established the subject's connection to unconscious processes
3. When complete, emerge with a standard count-up from 1 to 5 with suggestions of alertness, refreshment, and full waking consciousness
4. Suggest the arm feels normal and comfortable: "Your arm feeling perfectly normal, refreshed, and comfortable"

### Contraindications
- **Acute Shoulder or Arm Injuries**: Sustained arm elevation may cause pain or aggravate injury
- **Acute Psychotic Episodes**: Hypnotic induction inappropriate during active psychosis
- **Severe Dissociative Disorders**: Ideomotor responses may trigger dissociative episodes in vulnerable individuals
- **Severe Untreated Mental Illness**: Without psychiatric supervision, trance induction poses risks
- **Epilepsy**: Sustained focused attention and trance states may theoretically lower seizure threshold; consult neurologist

### Cautions
- Some subjects experience anxiety when their arm moves involuntarily; normalize the experience and reassure
- If the arm does not levitate, do not force or insist; transition smoothly to an alternative induction (e.g., progressive relaxation)
- Approximately 23-47% of medium-suggestible subjects may not achieve full levitation; have a backup strategy ready
- Prolonged arm elevation (>5 minutes) may cause discomfort; pace the induction to avoid fatigue
- Audio-only delivery works but is less reliable without practitioner calibration to the subject's micro-movements
- First-time subjects may intellectualize the experience, reducing ideomotor response; use permissive language to bypass analysis
- Post-session debriefing is important to process the novel experience of involuntary movement

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"Now focus all your attention on your hands resting on your thighs. Notice the sensations there -- the warmth, the weight, the texture of your clothing beneath your palms. And as you pay close attention, you begin to notice that one hand feels different from the other. Perhaps a lightness developing in your right hand... or your left. One of them is beginning to feel lighter, as if the force of gravity is slowly releasing its hold on that hand. And those fingers are beginning to feel a gentle tingling... a buoyancy... as if a warm current of air is flowing beneath them, beginning to lift..."

- **Source**: Adapted from Milton Erickson's arm levitation induction (Erickson & Rossi, 1979) and contemporary Ericksonian training materials
- **Context**: Opening phase of the arm levitation induction, establishing differential sensation and expectancy for ideomotor response
- **Duration**: This excerpt covers approximately the first 60-90 seconds of the induction

### Specific Language Patterns

1. **Differential sensation**: "Notice which hand feels lighter than the other..."
2. **Permissive suggestion**: "Your hand might begin to feel a gentle tingling..."
3. **Ideomotor reinforcement**: "Those tiny involuntary movements are exactly right -- your unconscious mind is responding..."
4. **Lightness metaphor**: "As if a warm current of air is flowing beneath your hand, lifting it gently..."
5. **Linking to depth**: "With every inch that hand rises, you go deeper into trance..."
6. **Pacing involuntariness**: "Your hand rising all on its own, at whatever speed feels right..."
7. **Eye closure link**: "And as that hand rises, your eyes become heavier, wanting to close..."
8. **Touch completion**: "When your hand touches your face, you'll be in a deep, comfortable trance..."
9. **Reinforcing the unconscious**: "Your unconscious mind knows exactly how to do this..."
10. **Settling deepener**: "As your hand drifts back down to rest, you go even deeper..."

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can NOTICE THE LIGHTNESS developing in that hand as it BEGINS TO RISE all on its own."
- **Presuppositions**: "When your hand begins to lift..." (presupposes it will lift)
- **Temporal Predicates**: "As that lightness continues to increase, your hand will begin to move."
- **Pacing and Leading**: "You're sitting comfortably... your hands resting on your thighs... and one hand is already beginning to feel different..."
- **Truisms**: "Your unconscious mind controls thousands of movements every day without your conscious awareness."
- **Ambiguity**: "You don't yet know which hand will be the one..." (creates expectancy for both)
- **Covering All Possibilities**: "Your hand may lift smoothly, or in small, gentle movements... quickly or slowly... your unconscious mind will find the way that's right for you."
- **Analogical Marking**: Soften and slow the voice on key words: "lighter," "rising," "deeper," "floating"
- **Dissociative Language**: "That hand... beginning to move on its own... as if it has a mind of its own..."

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Soft, fascinated, and gently expectant. The practitioner should convey genuine wonder and curiosity about the unfolding ideomotor response. Not commanding or directing -- observing and facilitating.
- **Pacing**: Very slow and deliberate. This is one of the slowest hypnotic inductions. Each suggestion should be delivered with pauses, allowing time for the unconscious ideomotor response to build. Rush nothing.
- **Emphasis**: Gently emphasize sensation words ("lighter," "tingling," "rising," "floating") with a slightly upward vocal inflection to subtly suggest upward movement. Use a downward inflection for deepening words ("deeper," "relaxed," "comfortable").
- **Volume**: Soft throughout. Begin at conversational volume and gradually become quieter as the induction progresses, drawing the subject's attention inward.
- **Calibration**: Watch the hands constantly. Reinforce the slightest twitch, finger separation, or upward movement immediately. The practitioner's real-time calibration and verbal reinforcement is what makes this induction succeed.
- **Timing**: Full arm levitation induction: 4-6 minutes (can extend to 10+ minutes with Ericksonian pacing). The arm typically takes 2-4 minutes to fully levitate from thigh to face level.
- **Audio Delivery**: Possible but less reliable than in-person delivery since the practitioner cannot see and respond to micro-movements. Audio versions should use more extensive suggestion patterns and allow extra time for the response to develop.

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Demonstrating the power of the unconscious mind to the subject; creating a dramatic, convincing trance experience; kinesthetically-oriented subjects who respond well to body sensation; trance ratification (proving to the subject they are in trance); building confidence in hypnotic ability for future sessions
- **Target Audience**:
  - Athletes exploring hypnosis for performance enhancement who benefit from a dramatic demonstration of mind-body connection
  - Executives and professionals experiencing hypnosis for the first time who need compelling evidence of trance
  - Performing artists developing their connection to unconscious creative processes
  - Clients who have been unsuccessful with other induction methods and need a kinesthetic approach
  - Hypnotherapy training demonstrations
  - Subjects with high kinesthetic awareness (dancers, athletes, bodyworkers)
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - First hypnotherapy session as a powerful demonstration of trance capacity
  - Trance ratification when a subject doubts they can be hypnotized
  - Gateway induction before post-hypnotic suggestion, visualization, or ego strengthening
  - Teaching self-hypnosis: the arm levitation provides a clear, objective signal of trance entry
  - Sport psychology: demonstrating the mind-body connection and the power of unconscious motor control
  - Building hypnotic confidence in subjects who will undergo multiple sessions

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Moderate
- **Rationale**: The arm levitation induction has a uniquely strong evidence base for a specific induction method because it was standardized and validated in the SHALIT (Hilgard et al., 1979), which demonstrated reliable correlations with established hypnotizability scales (r = 0.52-0.63). The ideomotor mechanism underlying the induction is well-established in the neurophysiology literature, with Landry et al. (2025) demonstrating distinct EEG signatures for ideomotor responses. Banyai et al. (2013) quantified success rates (53-77% for medium-suggestible subjects). The broader hypnosis evidence base (Milling et al., 2023: 49 meta-analyses) provides context for the clinical efficacy of hypnotic interventions regardless of induction method. Evidence is rated moderate because: (1) the SHALIT provides standardized validation specific to this induction method; (2) the ideomotor mechanism has neurophysiological support; (3) however, few studies compare arm levitation directly to other induction methods for therapeutic outcomes; (4) the 23-47% non-response rate in medium-suggestible subjects limits universality.

### Mechanism of Action
**How the Arm Levitation Induction Works:**
1. **Ideomotor Response**: Suggested or imagined movements produce unconscious micro-activations in the relevant muscles. The suggestion of lightness and floating activates subtle motor neuron firing that produces genuine, involuntary upward movement.
2. **Attentional Absorption**: Intense focus on hand sensations creates an absorptive state that narrows attention and reduces critical analysis, facilitating trance entry.
3. **Involuntariness Experience**: The subject experiences their arm moving "on its own," which creates a convincing subjective experience of trance. This is both a cause and effect of hypnotic depth -- the experience of involuntariness deepens trance, which deepens involuntariness.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Each increment of arm movement reinforces the suggestion, creating a positive feedback loop. The practitioner's verbal reinforcement ("that's right, it's lifting") amplifies this loop.
5. **Dissociative Processing**: The experience of "my arm is moving but I'm not moving it" creates a mild, therapeutic dissociation between conscious intention and motor behavior, which is a hallmark of the hypnotic state.
6. **Trance Ratification**: The visible, undeniable arm movement provides the subject with proof that something real is happening, overcoming skepticism and deepening commitment to the trance experience.

### Relationship to Other Techniques
- **Dave Elman Induction**: Elman's is faster and more directive; arm levitation is slower, more permissive, and more dramatic
- **Progressive Relaxation Induction**: Progressive relaxation works through parasympathetic activation (relaxation); arm levitation works through ideomotor activation (attentive focus) -- different neurological pathways
- **Post-Hypnotic Suggestion**: Delivered after the levitation establishes deep trance
- **Embedded Commands**: Can be woven into the levitation suggestions to deepen effect
- **Mental Imagery**: The visualization of lightness and floating during the levitation constitutes imagery-based suggestion
- **Safe Place Visualization**: Often used as the first intervention after arm levitation achieves trance

### Key Distinguishing Features
- **Dual Function**: Serves as both induction and trance verification simultaneously
- **Dramatic**: Provides visible, undeniable proof of trance to the subject
- **Ideomotor**: Activates a different neurological pathway than relaxation-based inductions
- **Kinesthetic**: Particularly effective for body-aware, kinesthetically-oriented subjects
- **Self-Ratifying**: The involuntary arm movement eliminates doubt about trance
- **Ericksonian**: Closely associated with Erickson's indirect, permissive hypnotic style
