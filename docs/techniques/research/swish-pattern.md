- **Year**: 2015
- **Title**: Evidence-Based Neuro Linguistic Psychotherapy: A Meta-Analysis
- **Journal**: Psychiatria Danubina, 27(4), 355-363
- **URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26609647/
- **Key Findings**: Meta-analysis reviewing 425 studies, with 12 meeting inclusion criteria, examining the effectiveness of Neuro Linguistic Psychotherapy interventions including submodality-based techniques. Found evidence to support positive effects of NLP-based psychotherapy, though noted a major lack of high-quality data from observational and experimental studies or randomized trials. NLP therapy including anchoring and submodality-based interventions showed an overall standardized mean difference of 0.54 for psychological outcomes.
- **Effect Size**: d = 0.54 (medium), CI = [0.20, 0.88]

### Supporting Studies

**NLP in Organizational Settings**
- **Authors**: Kotera, Y., Sheffield, D., & Van Gordon, W.
- **Year**: 2019
- **Title**: The Applications of Neuro-Linguistic Programming in Organizational Settings: A Systematic Review of Psychological Outcomes
- **Journal**: Human Resource Development Quarterly, 30(1), 101-116
- **URL**: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hrdq.21334
- **Key Findings**: Systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. Screened 952 titles, with seven studies meeting inclusion criteria. NLP techniques were found effective for improving work-related psychological outcomes including self-esteem and reduction of occupational stress. However, results were mixed, and the authors noted that "the benefits of NLP were both overpromised and undersupported" regarding methodological rigor.
- **Effect Size**: Positive effects reported across included studies; no pooled quantitative estimate due to study heterogeneity

**Swish Pattern as Visualization Technique**

- **Year**: 1985
- **Title**: Observations Concerning Research Literature on Neuro-Linguistic Programming
- **Journal**: Journal of Counseling Psychology, 32(4), 589-596
- **URL**: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1986-12180-001
- **Key Findings**: Early academic examination of NLP research methodology. Identified that much of the empirical research testing NLP was methodologically flawed, with researchers failing to properly operationalize NLP patterns including submodality interventions. Argued that negative findings in NLP research were largely attributable to poor research design rather than technique ineffectiveness. Called for more rigorous methodological approaches to studying NLP interventions.
- **Effect Size**: Methodological review; no effect sizes reported

Demonstrates the pattern's applicability beyond clinical settings into learning and skill acquisition contexts.
- **Effect Size**: Significant group difference favoring swish pattern intervention (p < .05)

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
**From NLP Practitioner Training and Research Sources:**
1. The swish pattern operates through submodality shifts -- changes in the qualitative properties of internal representations (size, brightness, distance, color, focus)
2. The technique requires identifying the critical submodality drivers that most powerfully affect the client's emotional response
3. Speed is essential -- the swish must happen rapidly (under 2 seconds) to create a neurological pattern interrupt
4. The desired self-image should be a dissociated image of the person they want to become (not a specific behavior replacement)
5. The pattern creates a directional change rather than a simple substitution, making it generative rather than merely corrective
6. Testing must be performed after installation to verify the pattern has taken hold
7. Five or more rapid repetitions are typically needed to install the pattern reliably

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Identify the Unwanted Pattern (1-2 minutes)**
1. Identify the specific unwanted behavior, habit, or response the client wants to change
2. Ask: "What do you see, hear, or feel just before you do [unwanted behavior]?"
3. Identify the trigger image -- the internal representation that immediately precedes the unwanted response
4. This is typically a close, bright, associated image that the client sees through their own eyes
5. Determine the critical submodalities of this trigger image (size, brightness, location, distance)

**Phase 2: Create the Desired Self-Image (1-2 minutes)**
1. Ask: "If you had already made this change, what kind of person would you be? How would you see yourself?"
2. Create a dissociated image of the desired self -- the client sees themselves as they want to be (NOT seeing through their own eyes)
3. This image should be compelling, attractive, and motivating
4. Adjust submodalities to make the desired image maximally attractive (bright, colorful, clear)
5. The image should represent a general self-concept change, not a specific behavior
6. Start this image small and dark, placed in the corner of the mental visual field

**Phase 3: The Swish (30-60 seconds per repetition)**
1. Start with the trigger image large, bright, and close (filling the visual field)
2. Place the small, dark desired self-image in the lower-right corner
3. On the command "SWISH!" -- simultaneously:
   - The trigger image rapidly shrinks, darkens, and moves away
   - The desired self-image rapidly grows, brightens, and fills the visual field
4. This swap happens in under 2 seconds
5. "Blank the screen" -- clear the mind completely (look around the room, open eyes)
6. Repeat steps 1-5 at least five times, increasing speed with each repetition

**Phase 4: Testing and Future Pacing (1 minute)**
1. Ask the client to try to bring up the original trigger image
2. If the swish is installed correctly, the trigger image will be difficult to hold -- it will automatically swish to the desired self-image
3. If the trigger image still holds, repeat Phase 3 with more intensity and speed
4. Future pace: "Think of a time in the future when this old trigger might occur. What happens now?"
5. The client should report that the desired self-image automatically replaces the trigger

### Contraindications
- **Severe Trauma / PTSD**: The trigger image identification phase may re-traumatize; use trauma-specific protocols instead
- **Active Psychosis**: Submodality manipulation requires stable reality-testing capacity
- **Severe Depression**: Clients may lack the cognitive energy to generate a compelling desired self-image
- **Dissociative Disorders**: Rapid submodality shifts may destabilize individuals with fragile self-structure
- **Active Substance Abuse**: Cognitive clarity required for submodality work may be compromised

### Cautions
- The desired image must be a self-image (identity-level), not a specific behavior -- behavior-level images produce less generative change
- If the wrong critical submodality is identified, the swish may not take hold
- Speed is essential; slow swishing reduces effectiveness
- The "blank screen" step between repetitions is critical -- without it, the brain may learn to reverse the swish
- The technique may need to be combined with other interventions for deeply entrenched patterns
- Not a substitute for evidence-based psychotherapy for clinical conditions

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"Good. Now I want you to see that trigger image -- big, bright, right in front of you. And down in the corner, small and dark, is that image of the new you -- that confident, resourceful version of yourself. Ready? On the count... SWISH! Watch the old picture shrink and fly away as the new you EXPLODES into full size, bright and vivid, filling your entire field of vision. Yes! Now blank the screen -- open your eyes, look around the room. Good. Let's do it again, even faster this time."

- **Source**: Adapted from Bandler, R. (1985). Using Your Brain -- For a Change. Real People Press.
- **Context**: Core swish execution phase, after trigger and desired self-image have been established
- **Duration**: 3-4 minutes for 5+ repetitions

### Specific Language Patterns

1. "See that old trigger image big and bright right in front of you..." (associated trigger access)
2. "And in the corner, small and dark, there's the you that you're becoming..." (dissociated desired self)
3. "SWISH! -- watch them switch NOW..." (rapid pattern interrupt command)
4. "The old image shrinks away as the new you EXPLODES into view..." (directional submodality language)
5. "Blank the screen. Clear it completely. Look around the room..." (state break instruction)
6. "Faster this time. The brain learns speed..." (increasing speed principle)
7. "Try to bring back that old image... notice what happens..." (testing installation)
8. "That new you is so compelling, so attractive, your brain naturally goes there now..." (presupposition of change)
9. "Every time you try to see the old trigger, it just swishes to the new you automatically..." (automaticity suggestion)
10. "Your brain has learned a new direction -- and it happens faster than you can think about it..." (generative change framing)

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded Commands**: "You can SEE YOURSELF as that confident person NOW"
- **Presupposition**: "As the old image fades away..." -- presupposes the old image will fade
- **Temporal Predicate**: "In a moment, when I say 'swish,' your brain will make this switch instantly..."
- **Pacing and Leading**: "You can see that image clearly now... and as it starts to shift... notice how the new you naturally takes over..."
- **Nominalization**: "That transformation" -- turns complex submodality change into a single event
- **Truism**: "The brain learns patterns quickly, especially when they happen fast..."
- **Analog Marking**: Vocal emphasis on "SWISH," "NOW," "EXPLODES" to mark critical moments

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Energetic, dynamic, and commanding during the swish execution. Calm and precise during setup. Curious and encouraging during testing.
- **Pacing**: Slow and careful during trigger identification and self-image creation. Explosive and rapid during the swish itself. The tempo shift IS the technique -- the contrast between slow setup and rapid execution creates the neurological pattern interrupt.
- **Emphasis**: Maximum vocal emphasis on the word "SWISH" and on the moment of submodality shift. Use volume, pitch, and speed changes to mark the switch point.
- **Duration**: Full technique: 4-6 minutes. Setup: 2-3 minutes. Swish repetitions: 1-2 minutes. Testing: 30-60 seconds.
- **Volume**: Moderate during setup; sharp increase at the "SWISH" command; return to moderate for testing.
- **Pauses**: Strategic pauses during image construction phases. NO pauses during the swish execution -- speed and momentum are critical.

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Habit interruption, replacing limiting self-images, breaking unwanted automatic responses, rapid pattern change, building a compelling self-concept, overcoming performance-limiting identities
- **Target Audience**:
  - Athletes with performance-limiting mental patterns (e.g., always seeing failure before competition)
  - Entrepreneurs and executives overcoming imposter syndrome
  - Performers with stage fright or pre-performance anxiety triggers
  - Individuals wanting to break habitual responses (nail biting, stress eating triggers)
  - Sales professionals replacing limiting beliefs about their capabilities
  - Anyone with a specific visual trigger that precedes an unwanted behavior
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Breaking the visual trigger that precedes a performance anxiety response
  - Replacing a self-image of "I'm not good enough" with a compelling desired identity
  - Interrupting automatic negative thought patterns before presentations
  - Changing the internal representation that triggers procrastination
  - Shifting from fear-based visualization to confidence-based self-concept before competition
  - Habit change where a specific visual or environmental cue triggers the unwanted behavior

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Emerging
- **Rationale**: The swish pattern is a widely practiced NLP technique with strong theoretical grounding in submodality theory and the broader principles of classical conditioning and cognitive-behavioral change. However, rigorous empirical research specifically on the swish pattern is limited.

**Strengths:**
1. Strong theoretical foundation in submodality theory and the well-established principle that internal representation qualities affect emotional responses
2. The broader NLP meta-analysis (Zaharia et al., 2015, d = 0.54) provides moderate support for NLP-based interventions
3. Speed of implementation -- the technique can produce noticeable shifts in a single session
4. Generative nature -- creates directional change rather than simple substitution
5. Extensive practitioner experience spanning 40+ years of clinical application since Bandler's 1985 publication
6. Low risk when properly administered by trained practitioners
7. Logical consistency with cognitive-behavioral principles of stimulus-response modification

**Limitations:**
1. No published randomized controlled trials specifically isolating the swish pattern
2. Most evidence is practitioner-reported or derived from NLP training contexts
3. The broader NLP evidence base has been criticized for methodological weaknesses (Einspruch & Forman, 1985)
4. Difficult to separate swish effects from other NLP techniques often used in combination
5. Individual differences in visual imagery capacity may affect technique effectiveness
6. Academic psychology has generally been skeptical of NLP claims

**Conclusion**: The swish pattern has emerging evidence based on broader NLP meta-analytic findings, theoretical consistency with established psychological principles, and extensive practitioner use. It is best positioned as a rapid performance-enhancement tool rather than a clinical intervention, and should be used within a broader change framework.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Development
- **1983**: Richard Bandler begins explicitly teaching submodality distinctions and their role in change work
- **1985**: The swish pattern is first published in "Using Your Brain -- For a Change" (Bandler, 1985)
- **1985-1990s**: The technique becomes a standard component of NLP Practitioner training worldwide
- **2000s-present**: Variations and refinements of the swish continue to be developed, including auditory and kinesthetic variants

### Key Principles
- **Directionality**: The swish creates a direction (from trigger toward desired self) rather than a simple substitution. This means the brain generalizes the change.
- **Speed**: The neurological change requires rapid execution. Slow swishing teaches the brain a slow transition, not an instant redirect.
- **Dissociation in desired image**: The desired self-image MUST be dissociated (seeing yourself from the outside). This prevents the technique from installing a specific behavior and instead installs an identity-level change.
- **Critical submodalities**: Typically size and brightness are the most powerful drivers, but each person may have different critical submodalities.
- **Blank screen**: Essential between repetitions to prevent the brain from learning to reverse the pattern.

### Swish Variations
- **Standard Visual Swish**: Size/brightness shifts (most common, described above)
- **Location Swish**: Images switch locations in the visual field
- **Auditory Swish**: Internal dialogue shifts from limiting to empowering voice
- **Kinesthetic Swish**: Physical sensation shifts from constricted to expansive
- **Designer Swish**: Identifies the individual's unique critical submodalities and uses those for the swap

### Relationship to Other Techniques
- **Anchoring**: The swish can be enhanced by firing a resourceful anchor at the moment the desired self-image fills the visual field
- **Circle of Excellence**: Can be used after swish to spatially anchor the new self-image
- **Reframing**: Addresses meaning; swish addresses representation. They complement each other.
- **Mental Imagery**: The swish is a specialized application of imagery with specific submodality manipulation rules
- **Cognitive Reframing**: Both change internal experience, but swish operates at the representational level while reframing operates at the meaning level
