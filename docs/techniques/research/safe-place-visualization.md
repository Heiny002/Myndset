- **Journal**: International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, Vol. 66, No. 2
- **URL**: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00207144.2018.1421356
- **Key Findings**: Safe place imagery serves as a critical regulatory tool in trauma therapy, helping patients manage allostatic overload by activating the parasympathetic nervous system and creating an internal sense of safety. The technique provides a psychophysiological counterbalance to hyperarousal states, enabling patients to access a self-soothing resource that can be activated on demand. The method bridges hypnotherapy with contemporary neuroscience models of affect regulation.
- **Effect Size**: Clinical significance demonstrated through reduction in subjective distress ratings and physiological markers of hyperarousal

- **Year**: 2022
- **Title**: Feeling Safe With Hypnosis: Eliciting Positive Feelings During a Special State of Consciousness
- **Journal**: Frontiers in Psychology (PMC)
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9201773/
- **Key Findings**: Post-hypnotic suggestions of safety are effective even weeks after therapeutic sessions. Therapeutic suggestions of safety work in highly stressful environments, including intensive care units, where patients tolerated non-invasive ventilation significantly better when given suggestions to feel safe. The study demonstrates that hypnotic safety imagery activates measurable psychophysiological changes associated with calm and security.
- **Effect Size**: Significant improvements in patient tolerance and subjective safety ratings post-intervention

- **URL**: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jclp.10099
- **Key Findings**: Safe place imagery originated as a clinical hypnosis imagery technique (Brown & Fromm, 1986; Korn & Johnson, 1983) and has been widely utilized across EMDR, CBT, and DBT treatment modalities. Resource Development and Installation (RDI) protocols incorporating safe place imagery showed significant improvements in emotional regulation and distress tolerance in complex PTSD patients. Safe place serves as a foundational stabilization resource before deeper trauma processing.
- **Effect Size**: Significant improvements in SUD (Subjective Units of Disturbance) ratings and emotional regulation capacity

- **Key Findings**: Comprehensive meta-analysis of hypnosis interventions over 20 years supports the use of hypnosis in clinical practice for anxiety, pain management, and stress-related conditions. Imagery-based hypnotic techniques, including safe place protocols, demonstrate consistent efficacy across clinical populations. Medical providers and mental health professionals are encouraged to consider hypnosis interventions as part of evidence-based treatment.
- **Effect Size**: Overall effect sizes for hypnosis interventions ranged from small to large depending on condition (d = 0.36 to d = 1.21)

## Implementation Protocol

### Clinical Guidelines
Safe place visualization is a foundational resource-building technique used across multiple therapeutic modalities (hypnotherapy, EMDR, CBT, DBT, CFT). It creates an internal mental sanctuary that the client can access at will for self-regulation, stress reduction, and emotional stabilization. The technique should be installed during a calm, resourceful state rather than during acute distress. Once installed, it serves as a portable self-soothing tool that can be activated through a cue word or gesture.

Practitioners should ensure the client selects their own imagery rather than imposing a specific scene. The place must feel genuinely safe and calming to the individual. Some clients may need to create an imaginary place rather than drawing on a real location, particularly trauma survivors for whom real locations may carry ambivalent associations.

### Step-by-Step Process

**Phase 1: Preparation and Induction (1-2 minutes)**
1. Establish comfortable posture and breathing rhythm
2. Guide progressive relaxation or use preferred induction method
3. Deepen relaxation through countdown or body scan
4. Confirm readiness to proceed with internal exploration

**Phase 2: Place Selection and Construction (1-2 minutes)**
1. Invite the client to allow a safe, peaceful place to emerge in their mind
2. This may be a real place, a remembered place, or a completely imagined one
3. The only requirement is that it feels completely safe, calm, and peaceful
4. Allow time for the image to form naturally without rushing

**Phase 3: Multisensory Enrichment (1-2 minutes)**
1. Guide the client through each sensory modality systematically:
   - **Visual**: Colors, light quality, shapes, distances, textures visible
   - **Auditory**: Sounds present (water, birds, wind, silence)
   - **Kinesthetic**: Temperature, textures underfoot, air on skin, body position
   - **Olfactory**: Scents and fragrances present in the place
   - **Gustatory**: Any taste associations (salt air, fresh mountain air)
2. Invite the client to notice the emotional quality of the place
3. Deepen the experience by suggesting they can make it even more vivid

**Phase 4: Resource Anchoring and Cue Installation (1 minute)**
1. Ask client to identify a single word or short phrase that captures this feeling
2. While in peak positive state, have client repeat the cue word internally
3. Optionally add a physical anchor (touching thumb and finger together)
4. Suggest that this cue word/gesture will reconnect them to this place instantly
5. Practice activating the anchor 2-3 times within the session

**Phase 5: Integration and Emergence (30 seconds - 1 minute)**
1. Suggest the safe place remains available anytime they need it
2. Future pace: "Whenever you feel stressed or overwhelmed, you can return here"
3. Begin gradual reorientation to the room
4. Count up or use preferred emergence technique
5. Debrief briefly about the experience

### Contraindications
- **Active psychosis or severe dissociative disorders**: Imagery may intensify dissociative episodes or blur reality testing without specialized clinical supervision
- **Severe agoraphobia with no safe place associations**: Some clients may find it impossible to identify any place that feels safe; alternative resource-building should be used first
- **Acute trauma within 48 hours**: Avoid deep relaxation/imagery work immediately post-trauma as it may interfere with natural processing
- **Clients with no capacity for mental imagery (aphantasia)**: Adaptation needed using body-sensation or auditory-based alternatives

### Cautions
- Some trauma survivors may experience intrusive memories when attempting to relax; have grounding techniques ready
- Real locations may carry mixed associations; imaginary places are sometimes preferable
- The word "safe" itself may be triggering for some clients; alternatives include "calm place," "peaceful place," or "comfort zone"
- Clients with high self-criticism or insecure attachment may struggle to feel deserving of safety; compassion-focused preparation may be needed
- Do not push for vivid imagery if the client is struggling; some experience the place more through feeling than visual detail
- Monitor for paradoxical anxiety responses during initial relaxation phase

## Practitioner Scripts & Language Patterns

### Example Script Excerpt
"And as you continue to breathe comfortably, I'd like to invite you to allow a place to come to mind... a place where you feel completely safe... completely at peace... This might be somewhere you've been before... or it might be a place that exists only in your imagination... There's no right or wrong answer... just allow whatever comes... And as this place begins to form, notice what you see around you... the colors... the quality of the light... perhaps the sky above... And notice the sounds of this place... the gentle sounds that belong here... And feel the temperature on your skin... the surface beneath you... comfortable and supporting... And with each breath, you can go deeper into this experience... making it more vivid... more real... more yours... And somewhere in this place, find the perfect spot... the spot where you feel most at ease... most protected... most completely yourself... And settle into that spot now... knowing that this is your place... and you can return here anytime you wish..."

### Specific Language Patterns

1. **Permission-based invitation**: "Allow a place to come to mind..." (avoids performance pressure)
2. **Inclusive alternatives**: "Real or imagined... remembered or created..." (validates all imagery types)
3. **Sensory layering**: "Notice what you see... hear... feel..." (builds multisensory richness systematically)
4. **Deepening through superlatives**: "The most safe... the most peaceful... the most comfortable..." (intensifies the resource state)
5. **Ownership language**: "This is YOUR place... it belongs entirely to you..." (creates personal agency and control)
6. **Temporal bridging**: "And you can return here anytime you need to..." (installs future access)
7. **Safety presupposition**: "As you rest safely here..." (presupposes safety rather than suggesting it)
8. **Progressive enrichment**: "And you can make it even more vivid... even more real..." (invites deepening without demanding it)
9. **Embodied safety**: "Notice where in your body you feel this safety most..." (grounds the experience somatically)
10. **Cue word installation**: "And find a word that captures this feeling perfectly..." (creates portable access point)

### Milton Model Elements
- **Embedded commands**: "You can FEEL SAFE here... you can RELAX COMPLETELY..."
- **Presuppositions**: "As you enjoy this peaceful place..." (presupposes enjoyment)
- **Truisms**: "Everyone has a place where they feel at peace..." (paces common experience)
- **Double binds**: "You might see this place clearly, or you might feel it first..." (either response is success)
- **Temporal predicates**: "Begin to notice... continue to deepen... allow yourself to..."
- **Tag questions**: "And that feels good, doesn't it?" (reinforces positive state)
- **Nominalization**: "This sense of safety... this feeling of peace..." (makes abstract states tangible)
- **Analog marking**: Vocal emphasis on key words: "completely SAFE... deeply PEACEFUL..."

## Delivery Notes
- **Tone**: Warm, gentle, nurturing. Voice should convey safety through its quality
- **Pacing**: Slow and unhurried. Allow 3-5 second pauses between sensory prompts to let imagery develop
- **Volume**: Soft to moderate. Slightly quieter than normal conversational speech
- **Breathing**: Practitioner should model slow, calm breathing audible enough for client to entrain
- **Duration**: Full guided session: 4-8 minutes. Quick self-access after installation: 30-60 seconds
- **Repetition**: The safe place should be practiced and reinforced across multiple sessions
- **Pauses**: Generous pauses after each sensory prompt (5-8 seconds) to allow imagery formation
- **Music**: Optional ambient sounds (nature sounds, soft instrumental) can enhance but are not required

## Performance Context
- **Best For**: Pre-performance anxiety management, stress recovery, emotional regulation between high-pressure activities, sleep preparation, and as a foundation resource before deeper therapeutic work
- **Target Audience**:
  - Athletes managing pre-competition anxiety and needing rapid calm-down tools
  - Executives facing high-stakes presentations or negotiations
  - Performers (musicians, actors, speakers) managing stage fright
  - Entrepreneurs dealing with chronic stress and decision fatigue
  - Sales professionals needing emotional reset between calls or meetings
  - Anyone experiencing situational anxiety or stress overload
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Pre-performance calming ritual (sports, stage, boardroom)
  - Recovery after stressful events or difficult conversations
  - Sleep onset facilitation
  - Anxiety management in the moment
  - Foundation resource for other hypnotic or therapeutic techniques
  - Break-time stress reset during intense work days

## Evidence Level Assessment
- **Rating**: Moderate
- **Rationale**: Safe place visualization has a broad clinical evidence base as a component of multiple evidence-based therapies (EMDR, CBT, DBT, CFT, clinical hypnotherapy), though few studies isolate it as a standalone intervention.

**Strengths:**
1. Widely used across multiple evidence-based therapeutic modalities (EMDR, CBT, DBT, hypnotherapy)
2. Grounded in attachment theory (Bowlby, 1988) and polyvagal theory (Porges, 2011)
3. Psychophysiological mechanisms well-understood (parasympathetic activation, cortisol reduction)
4. Post-hypnotic safety suggestions shown to persist for weeks (Schmidt et al., 2022)
5. EMDR research demonstrates efficacy of safe place as stabilization resource (Korn & Leeds, 2002)
6. Low risk profile makes it suitable for broad population use
7. Easily taught as self-administered technique for ongoing benefit

**Limitations:**
1. Most evidence comes from its use as a component within larger treatment protocols rather than as a standalone technique
2. Few randomized controlled trials isolating safe place imagery specifically
3. Effect sizes typically reported for broader imagery or hypnosis interventions rather than safe place alone
4. Individual differences in imagery ability affect outcomes
5. Mechanism research is largely theoretical rather than experimental

**Conclusion**: Safe place visualization is a well-established clinical technique with strong face validity, solid theoretical grounding, and consistent clinical support across multiple therapeutic traditions. While standalone RCTs are limited, its integration into multiple evidence-based protocols and its consistent clinical utility support its use as a reliable resource-building and anxiety management technique.

## Additional Notes

### Historical Context
Safe place imagery has roots in multiple therapeutic traditions:
- **Hypnotherapy**: Used as a deepening and resource technique since the classical era of hypnotherapy
- **Guided Affective Imagery**: Hanscarl Leuner's Katathym-Imaginative Psychotherapy (1950s) used safe place as a starting motif for therapeutic exploration
- **EMDR**: Francine Shapiro (2001) formalized safe/calm place installation as part of EMDR's preparation phase (Phase 2)
- **Attachment Theory**: John Bowlby's (1988) concept of a "secure base" provides the theoretical foundation for the internal safe place as an internalized attachment resource
- **Compassion-Focused Therapy**: Paul Gilbert incorporated safe place imagery as a core component of compassionate mind training

### Theoretical Mechanisms
1. **Attachment system activation**: The safe place functions as an internalized secure base, activating the soothing/affiliation system (Gilbert, 2009)
2. **Parasympathetic nervous system engagement**: Vivid safety imagery activates the ventral vagal complex, reducing heart rate and cortisol
3. **Counter-conditioning**: Repeated pairing of relaxation with imagery creates a conditioned calming response
4. **Cognitive resource**: Provides an attentional anchor that competes with anxious rumination
5. **Self-efficacy**: Demonstrates to the client that they have internal resources for self-regulation

### Adaptations for Specific Populations
- **Athletes**: Frame as "optimal performance zone" or "recovery sanctuary"; connect to sport-specific environments
- **Executives**: Frame as "strategic clarity space"; emphasize decision-making quality
- **Trauma survivors**: Use "calm place" or "comfort zone" terminology; allow full client control over content
- **Children**: Use playful language; incorporate favorite characters or magical elements
- **Performance anxiety**: Connect safe place to pre-performance routine as a reset tool
