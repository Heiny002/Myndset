# Myndset MVP - Progress Log
Started: January 21, 2025
Project Owner: Jim Heiny

## Codebase Patterns

### Project Architecture Principles
- **Performance positioning over wellness**: Every feature, copy, and design decision reinforces competitive advantage framing
- **Mobile-first PWA initially**: Speed to market with web app before native development
- **Manual approval workflow during MVP**: AI generates plans and scripts, but Jim reviews before delivery to ensure quality
- **Freemium with immediate value**: One free meditation to prove value, then conversion to paid tiers
- **Evidence-based personalization**: Component selection must map to psychological assessment, not generic content

### Technical Stack Decisions
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router for modern React patterns and excellent Vercel deployment
- **Database**: Supabase for integrated auth, PostgreSQL, and storage in one platform
- **AI Services**: Anthropic Claude for script generation (sophisticated reasoning), ElevenLabs for voice synthesis
- **Payments**: Stripe for reliable subscription management and customer portal
- **Hosting**: Vercel for seamless Next.js deployment and edge functions

### Development Best Practices
- **Typecheck always passes**: No commits without TypeScript validation
- **Mobile testing required**: Every feature must work on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- **Cost tracking critical**: Monitor API usage (Claude, ElevenLabs) to stay within bootstrap budget
- **Security first**: API keys in environment variables only, row-level security in Supabase, webhook signature verification
- **User feedback loop**: Beta testing before launch, analytics from day one, iterative improvements

### Component Selection Algorithm
- User assessment maps to specific meditation techniques based on resistance patterns and goals
- Session length determines structure (Quick: 2-3min, Standard: 5-10min, Deep: 15-30min)
- Educational background informs script vocabulary and complexity
- Mental/emotional state determines technique selection (e.g., high-energy → dynamic techniques)

## Project Context

### Product Vision
Myndset reframes meditation from wellness/stress-relief to **performance optimization tool** for ambitious professionals. Target audience: entrepreneurs, sales professionals, athletes, executives aged 22-32 who view meditation as competitive advantage and business investment.

### Core Differentiation
1. AI-driven personalization based on comprehensive psychological assessment
2. State-specific meditations for various mental states (high-energy, intense, focused)
3. Goal-oriented outcomes (close deals, win competitions, nail presentations)
4. Performance-focused messaging: "meditation for boardrooms, not yoga studios"
5. Future: Famous Mindsets - embody mental frameworks of legendary performers

### MVP Scope
- Progressive Web App (mobile-optimized, installable)
- Three-tier questionnaire system (8 + 5 + 10 questions)
- Two-step AI generation (plan approval → script generation)
- Magic link authentication (passwordless)
- Freemium model: 1 free meditation, then $9 Basic or $19 Premium tiers
- Remix feature: regenerate specific script sections
- Manual admin approval during validation phase

### Success Criteria
- **First 30 days**: 100+ visitors, 20+ completions, 10+ meditations, 5+ paid subscribers
- **Months 2-3**: 500+ visitors, 100+ completions, 50+ meditations, 25+ subscribers, $250 MRR
- **Months 4-6**: 2000+ visitors, 500+ completions, 200+ meditations, 100+ subscribers, $1500 MRR

## Iteration Log

### Iteration 0 - Initial Setup
- Created Ralph-structured prd.json from comprehensive PRD document
- Organized 36 user stories across 6 phases
- Established dependency chain for systematic execution
- Defined success metrics and technical constraints

**Key Learnings:**
- Breaking down large PRD into discrete, testable user stories enables autonomous iteration
- Each story has clear acceptance criteria that can be programmatically verified
- Priority ordering ensures critical path features are built first
- Dependency tracking prevents attempting tasks before prerequisites are complete

**Next Priority Stories:**
1. US-001: Set up development environment (Priority 1, Phase 1)
2. US-002: Create service accounts (Priority 2, Phase 1)
3. US-003: Configure domain (Priority 3, Phase 1)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why PWA Before Native App?
- Speed to market: weeks instead of months
- Cross-platform from day one (iOS + Android)
- Lower initial development cost
- Easier iteration and testing
- Can always convert to native in Phase 4 after market validation

### Why Manual Approval Workflow?
- Quality control during market validation phase
- Learn from user responses to improve AI prompts
- Catch edge cases before they reach users
- Build institutional knowledge about what works
- Can automate later after proven patterns emerge

### Why ElevenLabs Over Other TTS?
- Professional voice quality (not robotic)
- Emotional range for meditation context
- Reasonable API pricing for bootstrap budget
- Reliable uptime and fast synthesis
- Industry-leading naturalness

### Why Supabase Over Custom Backend?
- Integrated auth, database, and storage in one platform
- PostgreSQL with full SQL capabilities
- Row-level security built-in
- Generous free tier, predictable pricing
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Real-time subscriptions for future features

## Known Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **AI generation quality**: Mitigated by manual review workflow, iterative prompt improvement
2. **Voice synthesis costs**: Mitigated by cost tracking, tier limits, optimization after validation
3. **Storage costs for audio**: Mitigated by compression, CDN caching, usage-based pricing awareness
4. **Database query performance**: Mitigated by proper indexing, row-level security optimization

### Market Risks
1. **Conversion from free to paid**: Mitigated by proving value with first meditation, clear upgrade benefits
2. **Target audience identification**: Mitigated by beta testing, analytics, iterative positioning
3. **Competition from established apps**: Mitigated by differentiated positioning, unique personalization
4. **User retention after novelty**: Mitigated by remix feature, new meditation generation, future Famous Mindsets

### Business Risks
1. **Solo founder bandwidth**: Mitigated by MVP scope discipline, automation where possible, future hiring
2. **Bootstrap budget constraints**: Mitigated by cost tracking, freemium model for rapid user feedback
3. **Time to market**: Mitigated by phased approach, manual workflows initially, launch-and-iterate
