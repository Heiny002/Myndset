        "coreProcess": "Phase 1 - Hope Development (30-45 min): 1a) Goal setting: identify meaningful, challenging goal with specific milestones. 1b) Pathways thinking: brainstorm 3-5 different routes to achieve goal, develop contingency plans. 1c) Agency: recognize personal power and past examples of goal persistence. Phase 2 - Efficacy Development (30-45 min): 2a) Mastery experience activation: recall 3-5 past successes with full sensory detail. 2b) Vicarious learning: identify role models who've succeeded. 2c) Task breakdown: assess skills, plan progressive mastery. Phase 3 - Resilience Development (30-45 min): 3a) Asset recognition: inventory skills, support systems, past resilience. 3b) Risk management: identify obstacles, develop coping strategies. 3c) Cognitive reframing: learn from adversities, growth mindset. 3d) Influence expansion: focus on controllable factors. Phase 4 - Optimism Development (30-45 min): 4a) Realistic optimism foundation: distinguish from naive positivity, recognize genuine opportunities. 4b) Explanatory style: attribute successes to internal/stable/global; setbacks to external/unstable/specific. 4c) Positive expectancy: visualize positive outcomes with evidence-based reasoning. Phase 5 - HERO Integration (30-45 min): Recognize interconnections, create personal HERO statement, apply all four to current goal. Phase 6 - Ongoing: Daily 5-10 min practice, weekly 15-20 min review, monthly 30-45 min assessment.",

Pacing is moderate, allowing time for reflection and exercises in each HERO component. Emphasize the SYNERGY between components - HERO is greater than sum of parts. Duration: 2-3 hours for full PCI workshop covering all four components; 45-60 minutes for brief micro-intervention; 30-45 minutes per individual component focus; 5-10 minutes daily maintenance; 15-20 minutes weekly review. Volume is moderate and professional, conveying competence and possibility. Structure is systematic progression through HERO with exercises and reflection for each."
